UNSTICKING PREGNANCIES (Works for Petz 3 and Petz 4 and Petz 5)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This causes owners a lot of distress; their favourite pet is pregnant 
and due to some bug in the game, she never comes to term.  You've
tried everything you can think of, including putting the clock forward
for several years, and the poor thing is still stuck?  Well, I have a
method (which does still involve using the clock) which has worked on
every single stuck pregnancy, even the most stubborn.  So here it is:

Remember  _keep backups_ always before starting.  And don't have other 
petz in your Adopted Petz directory while you're doing this; only the 
single problem pet.

1. Remove all your other pets from the Adopted pets directory to a 
temporary one while you concentrate on the poor stuck mum-to-be.  
It's also important to make a copy of this pregnant dog or cat in that 
temporary directory (or somewhere else) in case of accidents.  Remember, 
pets are saved-game files, and any game can make random errors in a 
saved-game file even when you're not fiddling with it.

2. Close the game and Forward your clock to 2037. Putting the clock any 
further forward might produce the baby, but it will cause your game 
to crash if you try to select that baby afterwards.  Remember, _do not_ 
go any further forward than 2037!!  Open the game and bring her out.  
Is the baby born?

2.a If no, no problem.  Put her away or close the game and alter the 
clock back to 1980.  She might produce the baby then.  If not, repeat
steps 2 and 2.a, alternating 2037 with 1980, until the baby is born and 
you can move on to step 2.b

2.b If yes, good -- close the game, re-set your clock to the correct date, 
make another copy of your pet to put somewhere safe in case there's any
problem later (there never is, but I have a passion for backups which 
I've learned the hard way over many years), and then carry on. 

So far, if the cause was not a corruption in the mother or baby's data (and 
of course the game always reports corruptions), this treatment has always 
worked for me.  The most times I've had to time-swap before getting the 
most stubborn of pregnancies unstuck is about 6.

When she _does_ give birth, remember to change the clock back to the proper 
date, and then after you've closed the game you can bring all your other 
pets back from their temporary home.

If the baby is about to be born and you get an error message, then you've 
got a different problem on your hands.  See the list of errors and possible 
solutions in my other "howtos".

Enjoy!
