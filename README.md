# carolyns-bible
A searchable repo of all the petz/babyz docs created by Carolyn Horn. Carolyn's site is still up here https://homebody.eu/carolyn. Many of these txt files were not indexable by Google or buried in Zips so they were hard to find. I created this to make it much easier to find these files and search them. If you have any files I'm missing please let me know or do a pull reuqest.
