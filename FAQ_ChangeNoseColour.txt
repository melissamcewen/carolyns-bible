Ah yes, this is a little obscure.  Took me a while to work it out.
First off, you need to change the colour and outline colour for the 
;L nostril, ;R nostril, and ;nose (bottom) ballz.

Next, and this is the obscure bit, you need to change the Outline type
(otlntTyp) for the two nostrils.  I use -5 as the number for that, and
it works a treat.

Hope that helps -- happy hexing!

Note that for 2nd-gens the nostrils will revert to black.  See my notes
on 2nd-gens for information on dealing with this problem.
