

This zipfile contains a family of pigs; the parents were
adopted from the original P.F.Magic breedfile and therefore had been
"spayed" by default.  I have un-spayed them and successfully bred from
them; you can see that they are Gizelle's parents if you look at the
family history.

For more on breeding bunniez and pigz, and un-spaying pets, see my
pig and bunny breeding packs and my pet hexing tutorial.

Enjoy
