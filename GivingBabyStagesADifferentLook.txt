
I want my duckling to look like a ball of yellow fluff, but not my adult duck.
=========================================

This is how I do the trick:

In the adult .LNZ, in [Add Ballz], I put the extra fluff ballz and I make them very small.
I make a note of which ball-number each extra added ball is by the usual method of counting
down the lines of added ball data.

In the "kitten" or "puppy" .LNZ, I pop those ball-numbers into the [Ball Size Override]
section, putting each ball number on a new line with a space between it and the size that
I want the ball to be.

The babies will come out with the big fluffy balls, and they will gradually disappear as
the baby grows up as if the pet is moulting its baby-down.

I want the same as above, but I want extra balls to make wings, and they grow in funny
=========================================

Yes, I've done a lot of experimenting here and this is what works.  For this you are
either going to have to use external-lnz files or ResHacker, as the kitten or puppy file
is going to be much bigger than before unless you're using the Chinchilla Persian.

As before, in the adult .LNZ, in [Add Ballz], I put in all the extra ballz that I want.
I make the baby's fluff balls very small and I make the wings (or other extensions) how
I want them to look in the adult.

Now I take the adult [Add Ballz] section and paste that into the kitten or puppy area,
complete and untouched.  Now here comes the bit that you need to get right, or it'll be
very frustrating.  The number of ballz in this [Add Ballz] section needs to be the exact
same number as in the adult [Add Ballz].  Try adding in an extra one or removing one, and
your whole puppy/kitten add ball data will simply be disregarded by the game.

Right, there are only some things that can be changed between the two; but the important
things are these:  The ball size and the ball position.  It is much better to use this
method for ball position than, say, [Move], because you can sometimes get unpredictable 
results (crashes etc) if you list added ballz in [Move].

You will now find that the baby comes out as you wish, and will grow delicately into 
a fully-fledged adult.

Enjoy
