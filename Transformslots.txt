
How to get the maximum no. of Transformations for your breed
====================================================

You can have 5 Transformations for any given breed, but if you do that 
in my external-lnz "easy" packages, some of them will definitely overwrite 
each other.  I give you here an explanation and a solution for those who
want to have five Transformations for each of their new breedz.

The Explanation:
===============

External-lnz Transformations are picked up by the game from a limited 
number of "slots".

A "slot" in this context refers to how many names there can be for
Transformations. There are 51 name-slots. I managed to slip all the 
breed ones into usable slots, and one of them ended up left over. I chose 
to make it the 102 sheep on account of it was identical to the Zott 
one apart from the furfile. The actual names which I used could of 
course have been different, but I'd have had to alter the main game-file 
in order to do that, and it didn't seem to me to serve any gainful 
purpose since I was unable to increase the number of name-slots. 
Incidentally it would also be possible to redirect any given slot to 
anywhere else on the drive -- but any breed using these externally would 
still be having to overwrite another's.

I did indeed try, my game now has apparent extra name-slots in it -- but 
the Transformer won't pick up on them. If I put any number greater than 51 
into the Farminator Switches list for a breed, the Transformer simply 
returns me to the basic breed shape when it gets to that one. I imagine 
that a programmer with 16-bit Assembly language knowledge and the necessary 
tools would be able to alter this -- but I'm just a hexer. 

The solution:
=============

_However_, if you use internal-lnz breedz (the original unexternalised 
game ones, to be precise) along with my "alternative" LNZ package, you 
can give each of the breedz five individual Transforms, or at least some 
of them anyway -- I've not counted and checked the whole set this way. 
Some of the Transforms will have to be external, since the breedfile must
stay the same size (unless you want to re-calculate by hand everything 
from the List onwards, Aaaargh), but I'm sure you can live with that. 

Skorch, for instance, has only two -- he does really, it's controlled 
by the adult .lnz. The Skeleton and the "baby" which are FUTURE10.lnz 
and FUTURE11.lnz and are switches 39 and 40. So unpack the 
alternativesTransforms.zip into your non-external game. Open Skorch.odd 
in a hex editor and, in the "I am Skorch!" .lnz find the Farminator 
Switches. Change the list 39, 40, 39, 40, 39 to, say, 39, 40, 49, 48, 
47 and you will see that he's got three extra Transformations -- in 
this case they happen to look like some of Snowbo's, but you could edit 
them to be unique to Skorch. I can't face writing up an in-depth "howto" 
about that -- and I don't want to frighten off non-hexie players -- but 
I make you a present of it for your own hexing fun.

When you distribute one of these special full-transform breedz, package 
the .odd and .odx files along with the extra .lnz files, and explain in 
a readme  where the players will need to place these files.  You'll need 
to explain carefully or make them install automatically, because players 
can get it wrong and end up with game-crashes.

Enjoy!
