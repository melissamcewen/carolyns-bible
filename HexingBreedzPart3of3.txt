The Animator's Add Balls are a little different in each breed, because of 
the different needs that different breedz have.  For instance, the Tabby 
cat has stripes which need to be specified...  You can work them out by 
studying the relevant breed's .LNZ, so I include only the more standard 
ones here:

67 mount align ball
68 steal captured toy align ball
69 steal toy standing align ball
70 dig align ball
71 fill in hole align ball
72 rest on pillow align ball
73 drop object at point align ball
74 utility ball
75 utility ball
76 utility ball
(there's probably no need to touch 67-76 usually)

The following are different in some breeds; just check out the one you're working with:

77 } nose
78 }
79 }

80 } head -- Ears region
81 }
82 }
85 }
86 }
87 } left side top of head in front of ear (near jowl and cheek)
88 }
89 } right side top of head in front of ear (near jowl and cheek)
90 } ears
91 }

92} Fangs (See Alleycat) or Ruff (see maine Coon)
93}

The Animator's Add Balls are a little different in each breed, because of 
the different needs that different breedz have.  For instance, the Poodle 
has tufts which need to be specified...  You can work them out by studying 
the relevant breed's .LNZ, so I include only the more standard ones here:

67 mount align ball 
68 steal captured toy align ball
69 steal toy standing align ball
70 dig align ball
71 fill in hole align ball
72 rest on pillow align ball
73 drop object at point align ball
74 utility ball 
75 utility ball 
76 utility ball 
(there's probably no need to touch 67-76 usually)

The following are different in some breeds; just check out the one you're 
working with:

77   } ears outside; top spot on left 
78   }       and second from top right 
79   }       and second from top left?
80   } ears outside, top spot on right 
81   }      and third from top on R
82   }      third from top spot on L 

83   } tail
84   }  
85   }
86   }
87   }

88   }  tongue (or chin)

89   } test cover up part of jowls
90   } test cover up part of jowls
91   } cheek/jowls; go from cheek or mouth 
92   }              corners to snout or nose

93   } Inside mouth at front above chin; L
94   } Inside mouth at front above chin; R

As an example of differences and extra balls, take the Poodle:
poodle head puff 89-91
poodle puffs 92-95
poodle puffs without outlines for unshaved poodles 96-99

Petz II-5 colours
++++++++++++++

Here's a list which is pretty much complete; this is rough descriptions only, 
but I have provided also an HTML colour chart which should make them clearer.  
Silver of Silver's Petz, now long gone, had a chart also which was very nicely 
presented although incomplete, which spurred me on to try and make one for 
myself and include the remaining colours of the 256.

When you're trying out colours, it's best to switch the texture 
to "off" in the ball you're using (i.e.set its number in the Texture 
column to -1), or you may not see the colour properly.  You can 
experiment with a mixture of bitmaps and ball-colours to get the 
effect you want, of course.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
================

I want  to say a big "thank you" to Birgit of the PetzGallery for her 
encouragement and ideas, especially while I was struggling with the 
sound files in Petz 3 and just about ready to give up.  It was really thanks to 
her that I got my horse to have such full adult sounds.  

I'd also like to thank Anso who was the first to showcase my breeds
and who has been so very enthusiastic about them and full of new
ideas.

And to Abby of Petzwarehouse, who spurred me on to gather all my
notes together at last into an (I hope) coherent tutorial...
and who continued to encourage me, even hosting my growing site,
while I threw together all sorts of tutorials, "howto"s and game-
fixes.  Bless you for your patience and help!

++++++++++++end of tutorial

Enjoy!
