
This file is intended for the use of hexers and anyone who wants to
change their Petz 3 Toy Closet.

This Toy Closet.env file for Petz 3 will overwrite your game's original, and unless
you put everything in the correct place it _will_ crash your game, so please
please please make sure that you have your original safe somewhere and copies of
all your petz somewhere safe.

Place the Toy Closet.env in your game's resource\Area directory.
For non-english versions of the game, use instead the Spielzeugschrank.env.

Now unpack the included zipfile, called ToyclosetFilesP3.zip, into your game's
main directory (the directory which contains the Petz 3.exe file)

The unzipping process _should_ create a set of subdirectories with the needed files in

\art\Sprites\Area\ToyCloset

What you should get are a .flm and a .flh file -- these are the filmstrip
and filmstrip-info for the game.  You can edit them using Tinker, available
from my "Nicholas' Tools" page, or if you're a masochist you can do it the
old way, manually splitting and headering the frames.

Also in there are the  icon and the backdrop bitmaps.  These are simple
bitmaps and you can change these to whatever you wish in a paint program.

Have fun giving your petz nice new toy closets!

I would advise you not to try making it a separate playscene with its own ID number, as 
the game might crash if it contains two functioning toy closets.  Nothing to stop you
from putting different filmstrips into it, disabling the toyz, and then having it as a
separate one of course; experiment as much as you wish, the worst that can happen is a few
game-crashes while you try things out :-)

Cheers
