
This is an easy-edit kit for the Petz 5 Adoption Centre; it's also
a bit of nostalgia for Petz 3 and Petz 4 fans, because the daytime
backdrop is edited in from their games.

How to install
--------------

The Adoption Center.env goes in your game's Resource\Area directory of
course.  It will overwrite your game's original, so take care to move that
to somewhere safe first.  I will not send you the original if you mess
up, it's too big.

Unpack the included AdoptionCentreP5Externals.zip into the root directory of
your game (where the Petz .exe file is).  Everything should automatically go 
into the correct place.  If not, you will have to shift the files by dragging
and dropping them in Windows Explorer (or My Computer).  There should be 
a subdirectory off wherever you unzipped it, called art.  This 
subdirectory should contain another, called sprites.  This 
sprites subdirectory should contain another, called Area. This 
Area subdirectory should contain another, called AdoptionCenter.
Inside that AdoptionCenter directory you should see a bunch of files.

Drag and drop the whole nest of directories so that the subdirectory "art"
is directly off your game's root directory.  If you have already installed 
various of my "external-lnz" scenes, art\sprites\area will already be there; 
in which case just drag and drop the AdoptionCenter directory into it.

If you want the birdsong sounds to work in your Adoption Centre, download
and install also the P5areaSounds.zip file

That's it.  Now you're ready to edit the backdrops and sounds etc to your 
heart's content, as well as try your hand at .spr swapping to see what 
odd effects you can get. See my "Mad scientist" pages for info on how to 
sprite-swap.

Enjoy
