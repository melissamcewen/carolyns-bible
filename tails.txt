
Making long tails and removing catz whiskers...

How to control those pesky whiskers lines in Catz breedz
=========================================================

Okay, you've done everything you can think of -- made the whisker ball
-999, listed it in [Omissions], and still the dratted line appears! 
Aaaargh!  Well, the simple answer is here.  If you want no whiskers at
all, pop this into the breedfile on a line by itself:

[Whiskers]

If you want to have some whiskers lines and not others, then list the
whiskers you want underneath, for instance:

[Whiskers]
30, 57
31, 60

That's it.  Don't ask me how I found out how to do it; I look back at
all the years of my hexing explorations and often wonder if I simply go
crazy sometimes and try things at random :-)

How to make tails longer and more flexible
==========================================

Tails are more of a problem.  You want to fiddle with a few areas here;
first off you want to shift the basic tail ballz further apart from each
other using the [Project Ball] section.  Also, for it to look right with
stripes, you want to do what P.F.M did with the Tabby; and yes, it's
[Add Ball] ballz, but that's nothing to worry about.  Take a look at
the  Tabby's .lnz in Notepad or ResHacker.  See this:

[Project Ball]
44, 92, 50
45, 93, 50
46, 94, 50
47, 95, 50
48, 96, 50
44, 97, 35
45, 98, 45
46, 99, 50
47, 100, 65
48, 101, 75
3, 102, 50
3, 103, 50

All those in the first column are tail ballz, the last two being the
butt ballz, and the second column numbers are higher than 66 and so are
all [Add Ball] ballz.  The third column is how far apart they need to
be.

then, lower down:

43, 44, 100
44, 45, 100
45, 46, 100
46, 47, 100
47, 48, 100

These are all the basic tail ballz, with how far apart from each other
they need to be.

Okay, now we know how far apart everything is to be in the tail, we need
to create the extra ballz that make the stripes (and make the tail
longer). And here we have it all nice and clear for us.  I never do
understand why people refuse to see the .lnz as it should be; people who
edit direct into the hex editor are really editing blind.

43, 	30, 	-30, 	15, 	95, (etc)
43, 	-30, 	-30, 	15, 	95, (etc)

Now, the lines ;tailstripes92 and ;**note: kill 0 scale balls are
invisible to the game.  These kinds of line, which start with
semi-colons, are programmers' comments, put there to help them debug
their code etc, but they happen also to be handy to us hexers :-)  We
have been conveniently told that the following lines of code are all
added tail balls, and that these tail balls all start with ball number
92, which saves us the trouble of counting down the lines from ball 67
to find out which ball is which ball-number.  So in the original tabby
our first additional tail ball is ball number 92, the next one is number
93 and so on until we get to ball 103.  Each of these balls is given a
position relative to a base tail ball, as well as a size, colour,
fuzziness etc (as indicated by the column headers which are also
programmers' comments).  Now look back at the [Project Ball] section,
and maybe those numbers will now make sense to you?  Add Ball 92, which
is positioned relative to the base tail ball 43 by the x,y,z
(left/right, up/down, forward/back) co-ordinates -10, 0, 13 is also
distant from ball 44 by a factor of 50.

You can of course adjust the distances just about as much as you wish,
and add in extra tail ballz, as well as changing the fuzziness and size
of the added ballz.  I'm just showing you how P.F.Magic did it -- and of
course Studio Mythos didn't change any of that in Petz 5.

And that's how you make a long, luxuriant tail which doesn't behave
oddly :-)

In the Dogz games, you can get a similar idea of how to do it if 
you study Great Danes:

Enjoy!
