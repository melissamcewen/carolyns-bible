
First off, are you playing the game on XP?  If so, make sure you have
either Petza installed, available from Nicholas' site
http://www.sherlocksoftware.org/page.php?id=6
or, if that won't work for you, download and install my sound-fixed files
I made them before Nicholas did his fix, and a few people need them

If you've been playing the game on Windows 98 or 95 or on XP-with-fixes,
and you're starting to get unexplained crashes, then read on.

The game puts a lot of info into the Registry which can sometimes 
cause problems and which a simple reset doesn't always fix.  Re-installing
the game also doesn't always fix it.

The solution for people who have either a babyz who is wearing something 
missing, or a scene which contains a problem item, is this:

First of all, it's a good idea to remove all downloaded or hexed items from
the game, and put them somewhere safe, also all babyz.

If you have a Resource\Keys directory, delete all the .lkv files out of it.

Now open Regedit.exe (go to Start and then type Regedit.exe into the 
Run box and hit Enter) and use the crosses in the left-hand pane to navigate to

\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\PF.Magic\Babyz

Choose Edit Delete from Regedit's drop-down menus. Close Regedit and reboot 
your machine.

That solves most problems of this nature

Cheers!
