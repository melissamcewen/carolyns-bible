That's in the [Paint Ballz] area.  Take a look at the .lnz section
for the Dalmatian and you'll see how it works; from that, you will be able
to figure out what to add to the breed of your choice.  You've got, 
underneath the lines which relate to the paw pads (which all petz have),
what lookslike this:

;individual variation
;
#2.B
#1;right hand

Okay, those are the variations in spots, and the first balls that you
see listed are the ones for the front paws.  If you wanted to have the
spots the same each time, you would not bother with the "#" signs --
each # simply means "this is a different variation" and the double ##
means "this is the end of the variations for this ball or set of ballz".
The columns are clearly labelled, so you should be able to work out
easily which ball is to be painted (base ball), and with how big a spot
(diameter(% of baseball)), and where in the ball it sould go direction,
etc.

Similarly, in the Calico Cat you will see:

;individual variation
;
;
#3
#2
25,	45	1, -.8, -.6	65	15	3	-1	0	1	0
25,	35	.8, -.1, -1	65	15	3	-1	0	1	0
#1;left hip

so you know that these first variations relate to the hips.

A point of clarification here. I mention spots in detail in my Advanced 
tutorial; and there I use as references the Dalmatian spots and Calico 
patches, and what they look like in the original breedz' files, in order 
to show you what you would be adding in to any other breed to paint on 
spots or patches, _not_ just to show you how to change them in those two 
breedz.  Seems, from some emails I get, that people don't understand 
that fact.

Hope this helps
