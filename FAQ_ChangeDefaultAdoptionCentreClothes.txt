Adding Clothing to pets that come out of the Adoption Centre
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Some time ago, when I posted on the newsgroup the information on adding 
Antlers to Elks etc which I include in my Breedmaking tutorial, I was asked:

Well, first off, where it says [Flat Clothing], change that to [Add Clothing].  
Then, you can find out what the .lnz (.clz) for the given item of clothing is 
either by looking inside the .clo file or (a little easier perhaps) by putting 
the item on some pet, closing the game, and looking in the .pet file for the 
string art\Sprites\Toyz\

So, in the case of Glasses, you would have the "kind" is Glasses (you find that 
defined inside the Glasses file), the "toy_dll" is the .clo file Glasses.clo 
in your clothes directory, and the "lnz file" is Clot_Glasses.clz:

[Add Clothing]
; kind: Shirt,Pant, [snip stuff] ,Glasses
; kind       		toy_dll      	lnz file
#3.D
Glasses "\Resource\Clothes\Glasses.clo" "art\Sprites\Toyz\Clot_Glasses\Clot_Glasses.clz"

> OH, and is it possible to make it random?

Yes. You can make just about anything random in a .LNZ file with sensible use 
of variations; for instance, with my Minifluffies I gave them randomly coloured 
eyelids, just by putting in some extra # numbers.  Actually the thing that people
find more difficult is to hook variations together so that they are _not_ random,
LOL!

Experiment, it can't hurt so long as you've got everything backed-up.  That's 
part of the fun of it :-)

Enjoy
