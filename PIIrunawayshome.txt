
Petz II Runaways, more help to get them back.
=============================================

You can get runaways back every time, forcing  Petz II petz back into
the game, if you follow this procedure.

Remember to remove all your other pets from the Adopted  pets directory
while you concentrate on the Runaway.

Open your runaway .pet file in your Hex editor.  Look at the first two
bytes  in the Hex numbers section of the editor; in the ASCII section
they will look  like two dots or weird characters just before the name
of the pet.  It's the  Hex numbers that you want to note, though.  They
will be numbers such as BD 0B  (or it may be grouped as BD0B in some hex
editors -- it's still two bytes).  Make a note of these numbers.  They are
a kind of "ID" number, to identify your pet to the game.

Now run Regedit.exe.  -- go to Start, choose Run, and type in Regedit.  
You'll get something that looks a little like Windows Explorer. Navigate, 
clicking on the crosses on the left hand side as you would with W.E., to  

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\PF.Magic\Petz II\1.00.01

Click on that "directory" of 1.00.01. Now look at the Right-hand side.
Scroll  down to "Pets in Playpen" and double-click on it.  _Replace_ the
first two digits  which are probably 00, if all your pets have run
away!) with the first two-digit  number you noted down -- in my example,
BD, and replace the next two-digit byte  with 0B.  So the Value data
will look like this: BD 0B 00 00.  There  will be 4 two-digit numbers
only -- no more than that; it allows for two pets to be in the game at
once, you see.  Click "ok" and close  Regedit.exe.

Make sure that your pet's .pet file is in the "Adopted Petz"
subdirectory of  your Petz game directory, and all required .dog or .cat
files are in the relevant  directories. Run the Petz game, and your
chosen pet should come out of the door right  away.  Give it a fair bit
of cossetting to make it happy again.  It'll still be  classed as
"Runaway", as you will see if you click on the "pick a pet" button and
scroll down so that it highlights the pet in question. You can close
the  program and open it again and the pet will still come out for you
as long as  its first two bytes are in the registry  and the pet file is
in the "Adopted  petz" directory.

This is the old method, which let you play with the pet but which kept
it classed as Runaway.

Now, you want your pet to be permanently non-runaway so that you can
put it away and bring it back out again as you always used to.  So
here's what you need to do now.

First, change the byte at address hex 348 to 00 from 01. I have a more
detailed page with illustrations about this, but the basic info is here.
You have to have some knowledge of editing .pet files before you try this, 
also as always you will make sure you have a safe copy of the pet somewhere 
first, won't you? This is pretty obscure, but if you concentrate you should 
be able to do the job. Open the pet in a hex editor and scroll down to 
address 840 (decimal) or, if you prefer hex notation, 348 (hexadecimal). 
In a Runaway pet, this byte is hex 01. Change that to hex 00. You will 
then have to compensate for the checksum; just increase a nearby number by 01.

Now you're almost there.  You can either do my old method, now, of
putting the pet's ID number in the registry, and use the brain-sliders
to reduce it's "neglect" when it's in your game,

or you need to change a second byte within the pet.  It didn't occur 
to me to mention this in my earlier howto, so my thanks to Richard Hartman
for the "heads-up".

The second byte is in the petfile's energy, fullness etc section.  In
Petz II it is in a different place from the other games' petfiles.  You
can do it manually or, after the pet is in the game using the above
method, use the "brain-slider" to reduce slider 16 to zero.  If you want
to do it manually, here's what you need to know.

What you have with a Petz II pet is that the "neglect" indicator is
lower down the pet file and it's among more indicators (Petz II pets
have 17 of them).  So you have numbers which look like this, starting at
offset 7FB0, in the hexadecimal pane of the editor:

60000000 <-- energy (High for lots of energy)
2D000000 <-- hunger (low number makes pet hungry)
3A000000 <-- fatness
00000000 <-- sickness
00000000 <-- catnipped (acts weirdly if high)
00000000 <-- fleas
08000000 
5B000000 
60000000 
01000000 
5A000000 
4C000000 
04000000 
00000000 
00000000 
64000000 <-- neglect.  If this is high you're in trouble.
64000000 <-- age.  0 is just born, 64 is full adult.

(The numbers will of course be different in different petz.)
The numbers in between those that I have given names to I've not delved
into in depth, but they relate to various things such as walking,
talkativeness, seriousness and so on.

So what you need to do is to change that neglect from 64 to 00.  Change
the one before it  -- the 00000000 -- to 64000000 to compensate; it does
no harm and, if you use the brainsliders after the pet is in the game,
you can reduce that safely back to 0 (it's slider 15).  It's a neat idea
to use the brainsliders, it keeps your pet's state of mind clear and you
won't suffer from nasty shock runaways if you keep slider 16 down to 0.

Now, you maybe wonder what I'm talking about as regards the brain
sliders.  They are a small entry into the Registry.  I mention it 
elsewhere, but her it is also for completeness.  You can do it
manually if you want,   Entering it manually, you would open 
Regedit.exe, navigate to the key

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\PF.Magic\Petz II\1.00.01

Choose New, Binary value, from the Edit menu, rename the new value
Show Slider Brain 
and double-click on it.  Type in the number 01, then okay, then
close Regedit. 

Or if you prefer, you can make a little text file containing
everything between the ********** marks below, save it with a .reg
extension, and double-click to have it enter the data.

**********
REGEDIT4

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\PF.Magic\Petz II\1.00.01]
"Show Slider Brain"=hex:01
**********

To turn it off of course, you change that hex:01 to hex:00.  You
will be able to monitor the pet's happiness; the sliders 1 to 17
correspond to the list I show above.

Enjoy
