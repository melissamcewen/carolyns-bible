These coloured balls appear sometimes with early versions of the more 
complicated hexed breedz, where I have not paid enough attention to [Omissions]
and so some "hidden" ballz appear.  They appear usually when the pet is 
particularly excited, and when it's chickenz or Turkeyz that do it I always 
think it looks like a weird way of trying to lay eggz :-)

In fact, I now deliberately have two verions of chickens and turkeys for
you to choose from; one that has these "eggz" and one that hasn't.

If you have a pet that was adopted from one of these early breedfiles, or
from my "egg-laying" versions of the Turkeys and chickens,  Just put
the affected pet away through the door and bring him out again, and the balls 
will all have disappeared until he gets too excited again.

These ballz do absolutely no harm to your game or pets.  They are not contagious.
