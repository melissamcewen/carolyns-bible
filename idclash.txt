Just a note about an ID clash...

I think that not everyone realises that ID clashes can happen
 between dogz and catz breedz, not just between catz and catz
 or dogz and dogz.  It's _all_ the breedfiles in your game
 that count; every one of them needs to have an individual ID
 number or they won't work.

If you suspect that the ID-clash Syndrome has hit your game,
 first off remove all the pets from your game and then remove
 _all_ hexies from the game, from both the dogz and catz
 directories if you have both.  Make sure that all the originals
 are in place.  Run the game.  

Are all the basic breedz showing up?  

1.If No, you have a different problem.  If it's Petz 5, you
 may have the "bottom-drop-off nasties", and to fix that
 just put back into the game a breed that's near the bottom
 of the alphabet, such as Unicorn or Zebra.  If it's Petz 4
 or lower, then the problem may turn out to be a corrupted
 breed.

2.If Yes, you can find out which is the clashing breed by
 closing the game, putting some breedz back, and opening it
 again to check if they all show up. Continue to do this
 until the rogue breed is in there and it (or one of the
 others) doesn't show. 

Ta-da! Game back to normal

Enjoy
