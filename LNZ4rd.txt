
Sorry, this chunk is still to be done.  I'll be putting together 
a proper tips and syntax page here;  I hope to get it
done soon, Real Soon, Honest.  Meanwhile I've got them grouped
together with some cryptic comments.  Actually I think that these
are pretty obvious, but I _will_ do the details anyway.
