
Question: Awww, I wanted to use it with Dogz 4.  Will there be a version for that soon?

Answer: Yes, there will be -- also catz will be enabled soon. I've sent Nicholas 
some stuff he needed, plus I hadn't realised that he didn't have the catz part 
of the game so I gently pointed him to my "catz in dogz" files, and he's already 
making changes.

Meanwhile, you can fool the program *wicked grin*. Make a small text file and call 
it p5.reg, and put into it the stuff between ******* below:

*******
REGEDIT4

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\StudioMythos\Petz 5\4.00.00]
"Petz Root Path"="N:\\PETZ4"
"Petz Full Program Name"="N:\\PETZ4\\PETZ 4.EXE"
*******

Now change the bits with N:\\PETZ4 to whatever place your game is installed -- maybe 

C:\\Program Files\\P.F. Magic\\Petz 4

-- and save, then double-click on that .reg file.

Almost there. Now go to your Petz 4 Resources directory, and rename Petz 4 Rez.dll 
to Petz 5 Rez.dll and Dogz 4 Rez.dll to Dogz 5 Rez.dll. Start PetWorkshop.exe. 
Ta-da!!! it works :-)

Err, remember to change the names of those two dll files back again before running 
the game! And of course the same principle applies to Petz 3.

Enjoy!
