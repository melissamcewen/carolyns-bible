
This is an easy-edit kit for the Petz 5 Family Room; it also is edited
in such a way that, if you wish, the rainy-day effects won't happen.
This is for people whose machines go ultra-slow when the rainy-day scene
kicks in, to stop weather-effects from sometimes happening the instant 
you start the game.  If you want the weather-effects back again, download
and install the FamilyRoomWeatherSpr.zip file.

How to install
--------------

The Family Room.env goes in your game's Resource\Area directory of
course.  It will overwrite your game's original, so take care to move that
to somewhere safe first.  I will not send you the original if you mess
up, it's too big.

Unpack the included FamilyRoomP5Externals.zip into the root directory of
your game (where the Petz .exe file is).  Everything should automatically go 
into the correct place.  If not, you will have to shift the files by dragging
and dropping them in Windows Explorer (or My Computer).  There should be 
a subdirectory off wherever you unzipped it, called art.  This 
subdirectory should contain another, called sprites.  This 
sprites subdirectory should contain another, called Area. This 
Area subdirectory should contain another, called FamilyRoom.
Inside that FamilyRoom directory you should see a bunch of files.

Drag and drop the whole nest of directories so that the subdirectory "art"
is directly off your game's root directory.  If you have already installed 
various of my "external-lnz" scenes, art\sprites\area will already be there; 
in which case just drag and drop the FamilyRoom directory into it.

If you want the birdsong, fire and window sounds to work in your Adoption Centre, 
download and install also the P5areaSounds.zip file.

That's it.  Now you're ready to edit the backdrops and sounds etc to your heart's 
content, as well as try your hand at .spr swapping to see what odd effects you 
can get. See my "Mad scientist" pages for info on how to sprite-swap.

Enjoy
