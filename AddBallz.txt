
Add Ballz
=========

Are you seeing the .lnz set out the way it's supposed to be, with the columns 
under their headers? In [Add Ball], the column headers are like this:

;base x y z color otlnCol spckCol fuzz group outline ballsize bodyarea addGroup texture

Okay, they mean much what they say.  Any number in the first column is the base 
ball relative to which you are adding your ball.  The numbers in the x, y and 
z columns are the co-ordinates of the added ball relative to the base ball.  
The fourth column, headed by "color" is the colour of the added ball, then you 
get the outline colour, then the speckle colour (which is really meaningless 
in the games from Petz II onwards), then the amount of fuzz, then the group 
to which the ball belongs, then outline thickness and ball size, then the 
bodyarea (makes a difference in Petz II and can make a difference in 
2nd-gens in Petz 3-5).  Don't worry about addGroup, which comes next, 
but don't confuse it with Texture which comes after that.  Some of the 
lines (notably the tongue Add Ball) have a column after that which has 
no header; the number in that column re-confirms (or "fixes") the base ball.

I hope that helps!
