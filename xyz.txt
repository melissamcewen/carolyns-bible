
MOVING THE SPOTS / PATCHES

Here is an example sent to me a while ago; I was being asked how to
move the [Paint Ballz].  What I say below applies also to [Add Ball]
ballz' x,y,z positions, and it's also something that might help
you to understand about the x,y,z shifts in [Move].

First off, what I was sent was a copy of data which showed that my 
questioner was editing directly into the hex editor.  I edit in a totally 
different way, so what she was showing me makes very little sense to me.  
People who edit direct into the hex editor are trying to "paint by numbers", 
counting laboriously the number of dots or numbers or spaces until they 
get to the number they want.  How can they possibly really _understand_ 
the files that way??  The way I do it, I get to see the thing laid out the 
way it's supposed to be, as a text file with columns that have handy headers 
(programmers' comments really, designed to help them but it also helps us hexers).

Instead of

> atch..48,  80   -
> 9, -.7, -5       
>    .109.35.4.-1.
> 5.0..##

we would then see it as

[Paint Ballz]
;base ball diameter(% of baseball)  direction   color outlinecolor (etc)
;paws
;belly patch
48,  80   -9, -.7, -5               109 35 4 -1 5 0

See?  Much clearer, and you can see that the base ball is 48, the diameter 
is 80, the x,y,z are -9, -.7, -5, the colour is 109, the outline colour 35, 
and so on.

Okay, on to moving spots.  Each ball on a pet or babyz has three co-ordinates, 
just as every part of your own body does.  Your fingernail is on the top of 
your finger and centrally placed.  So, relative to the centre of your 
finger-tip, its x direction is zero (neither to left nor right), its y 
(up/down) direction is "up" by a certain amount, and its z direction 
(forward/back) is slightly forward.  In Petz and Babyz, these co-ordinates, or 
"directions", are shown by numbers.  The x is more negative or positive 
depending on whether the added ball is to left or right, the y is more 
negative if the added ball is higher up, and the z is more negative if 
it's further forward.  The same applies to paint Ballz, except that in 
this case the ball is always on the surface of the base ball, so the 
position is all to do with where on the surface it is -- to one side 
or the other, closer to the top, or closer to the front.

Oh, and I can never remember whether more negative for the x position
is more left or right -- even after all these years, I _still_ have to
guess.  One of these days I'll actually remember to note it down...

I hope that helps
