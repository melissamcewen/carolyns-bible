          For Petz 3, 4 and 5
          For Babyz
Addendum: How to make new toyz work separately (updated July 2004)

Introduction
============

This is intended to explain how to un-hide toyz and give them on-shelf graphics
where needed.  It also explains how to re-arrange the items that they need in 
order to edit some toyz that were previously thought to be un-hexable (such as 
the Milk).

Petz 3, 4, 5 and Babyz all have "hidden" toyz, which are toyz that either
appear in specific playscenes only and can never be taken elsewhere (such
as the Petz mosquito or hermit crab and Babyz bunny or big teddy) or which
appear occasionally in scenes and need to be gathered into the carry-case.
There is even the occasional toy, such as the Surprise.toy in Babyz, which
never appears at all and seems to have no purpose, and there are toyz which
are partly contained within the game's .dll files.

Note that when I talk about .lnz, .bdt, .bhd, .scp, .spr, .flh and .flm
sections or files, I'm expecting you to know the basics of hexing and how to 
find sections within the .dll or .toy files.  You can either find them by 
using the old hexing methods or by using a resource editor such as ResHacker
to extract them.  I'm also assuming that you know how to use the tools,
whether you're using a hex editor or a resource editor.  Finally, I'm
assuming that you know how to edit .lnz sections (they work the same way
as breedfile .lnz and clothes .clz sections) and how to edit Filmstrips
in Petz 3, 4 and Babyz (see my tutorials on that if you don't yet know how).

And remember -- always, always keep a backup copy of your original in case
anything goes wrong.

Petz 5 Special case
===================

In the case of Petz 5, of course, all toyz need to be gathered into the
carry-case because there is no Toy Closet.  I have a registry and key fix
in my P5 toy zips for people with that game.  In addition to changing the necessary
bytes that I'll be showing you later in this "howto", you will have to alter your
Registry and key to allow for the extra toyz.  If you "un-hide" all the toyz
which have on-shelf graphics, you will have 135 toyz in the case and you will
need to enter hexadecimal 87 into the Registry.  If you were to "un-hide" all 
the ones also which do _not_ have the graphics, you would have 157 toyz, and 
would need to enter hex 9D into the Registry; but I do not advise this, as
several of these will crash the game.  I've not checked them all to see which
cause crashes and which don't, but I can tell you that the "unhidden" Treasure 
Chest and Pirate Flag crash the game while the Blue Butterfly and Beetle do not.
This is true whether you add on-shelf graphics or not.
 
I include a zip containing a fixed-up .lkv file for you to place in your game's 
Keys directory; if you choose to un-hide all the toyz, it will allow them into 
your carry-case.  Don't forget that you need to enter 9D into the Registry, into
the "Case ListSize" in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\StudioMythos\Petz 5\4.00.00
If you're going to add extra, new toyz, you will need to make that 9D into a larger
number (as with my Mint Bottle, I needed to enter 9E) and you'll need to add an extra
bit onto the .lkv file (as I did with my Mint Bottle, downloadable separately at
my site).

If you want to un-hide all the hidden Petz 5 toyz and test them, you can give them
"on-shelf" graphics by taking a .spr section from some other item -- a clothes
item, for instance, which you wouldn't expect to see on the toy shelf -- and
either inserting it into the .toy file using a Resource Editor or placing it
in a subdirectory on your hard drive.  If you choose the latter method, you
must first make the subdirectory, off your game's main directory, which will
be called art then you must make another one, off that one, which will
be called sprites then another one, off that one, called toyz -- and finally
another one, off that one, called by the sprite-name of your toy.  For
instance, look at the blue butterfly which I have for download at my site.
In the zipfile you will find the butterfly toy and a .spr file called 
fbug_b2_away.SPR.  This file needs to be in this subdirectory, off your
game's root directory:

\art\sprites\toyz\fbug_b2

and my version of the beetle comes with a file, called fbug_b1_away.SPR,
which needs to be in this subdirectory:

\art\sprites\toyz\fbug_b1

If you'd rather use a resource editor such as ResHacker to add the spr
to the toy file, go ahead -- but I do not give lessons in using resource
editors, sorry.  This is because I'd have to make separate "tutorials"
for each resource editor, and I just don't have the time.

Petz 5 SPR sections are, at the time I write this, not editable in any
useful way (sept 2003).  You can swap around on-shelf graphics in the
manner that I show above, so that you can make your clothes or toyz
show up a little differently.  And you can still edit any toyz that use
.lnz files:
 
the Auto-rolling ball, the driftwood, the fish-bone, the bone, the stick, 
the milk, and the tug-toy.

Of these the Auto-rolling ball, the driftwood, and the fish-bone have their 
.lnz sections actually in the toy files and you can edit them in the same way
as Petz 3 and 4 people are able to edit them.

The bone, the stick, the milk, and the tug-toy have the .lnz only in the 
huge PetzRez.dll, and you can make new toyz from them by either putting the 
.lnz, .bdt, .bhd and .scp sections into a special directory on your hard drive 
or by using a resource editor and inserting them into your toy.  

These four sections need to go into a different directory from the .spr sections.
In this case you need to make a PtzFiles directory and then, off that, make one
with the name of your particular toy's base.  For instance, my "Mint Bottle"
has Mint.lnz, Mint.scp, Mint.bhd, Mint0.bdt in the directory

\PtzFiles\Mint

For Petz 3, 4 and 5:
====================

NOTE:  For several toyz, there is no animation for them being on the shelf, 
so you have to grab at what looks like blank shelf to make some of them 
appear in the hand.  Even if you add on-shelf graphics, when you do get them 
out into the scene, these particular ones cannot always be cleared up back into 
the closet or the carrycase. In order to get rid of the most stubborn ones once 
you've got them in a scene, just close the game, remove the relevant .toy files 
from your toyz directory, and then open the game again.  This is a good way to get 
rid of various problem toyz, by the way, such as spare paint brushes or surprise-box 
tops.  This may seem a bit messy, but it's quite funny to have the tortoise trundling 
around in the toyroom. If you want these particular toyz to appear in other scenes,
then you need to edit the playscene itself so that it starts up automatically
with them in place.  I shall cover that sort of thing in my playscenes-hexing 
tutorial.

Put simply, you can make toyz, which are normally "hidden", become available 
from the toy closet or, in the case of Petz 5, from the carry-case, by changing 
one byte which is three bytes after the ID number.  You change this byte from
hex 01 to hex 03.  02 will also work -- in fact, just about anything that
isn't 01 or 00.  But 03 is a good sturdy number that definitely works :-)

Take the Petz 4 and 5 beetle for example, and find its ID number 
(what we all call the "offset byte").  You can do that by searching for
Beetle and finding the place which looks like this:

00016992 | 0000 0000 4265 6574 6C65 0000 0000 0000 | ....Beetle......
00017008 | 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 | ................
00017024 | 0000 0000 9927 0000 0100 0000 0000 0000 | .....'..........

change the 0100 which you see 3 bytes after the ID number (which in this 
case is 9927) to 0300, as for the toys that we are supposed to see.
For instance, you can see it clearly in the dog brush:

00017408 | 0000 0000 426C 7565 2044 6F67 2042 7275 | ....Blue Dog Bru
00017424 | 7368 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 | sh..............
00017440 | 0000 0000 2627 0000 0300 0000 0000 0000 | ....&'..........

So that line in the beetle would look like this in your hex editor 
if you want it to be in the toy closet:

00017024 | 0000 0000 9927 0000 0300 0000 0000 0000 | .....'..........

or take the Petz 3, 4 or 5 Hermit Crab:

00019040 | 0000 0000 4865 726D 6974 2043 7261 6200 | ....Hermit Crab.
00019056 | 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 | ................
00019072 | 0000 0000 2B27 0000 0100 0000 0000 0000 | ....+'..........

change the 01 to 03:

00019040 | 0000 0000 4865 726D 6974 2043 7261 6200 | ....Hermit Crab.
00019056 | 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 | ................
00019072 | 0000 0000 2B27 0000 0300 0000 0000 0000 | ....+'..........

The above two examples will appear as a blank space in the toy closet.  
There are some toyz which are "hidden" in that they don't appear in the toy 
closet, but that will show up properly in the closet, complete with proper 
picture, when you hex their number as shown above.  These are the items -- 
shells, hairball etc -- which you can collect and place in your carrying case.  
Those items will of course go back into the closet properly when you hit 
"Cleanup Area".  Note that "Clean up toy Closet" clears up more of these
items than simply "cleanup area".

If you want to un-hide all the hidden Petz 3 and 4 toyz and test them, you can 
give them "on-shelf" graphics by copying a .flh and .flm section from some other 
item which does have an "AWAY" .flh/.flm set -- and either inserting it into the 
.toy file using a Resource Editor or placing it in a subdirectory on your hard 
drive.  If you choose the latter method, you must first make the subdirectory, 
off your game's main directory, which will be called art then you must make another 
one, off that one, which will be called sprites then another one, off that one, 
called toyz -- and finally another one, off that one, called by the sprite-name of 
your toy.  For instance, look at the blue butterfly which I have for download at my site.
In the zipfile you will find the butterfly toy, a .flh and flm files called 
fbug_b2_away.flh and fbug_b2_away.flm.  These files need to be in this subdirectory, 
off your game's root directory:

\art\sprites\toyz\fbug_b2

and my version of the beetle comes with a pair of files, called fbug_b1_away.flh
and fbug_b1_away.flm, which needs to be in this subdirectory:

\art\sprites\toyz\fbug_b1

If you'd rather use a resource editor such as ResHacker to add the flh and flm
to the toy file, go ahead -- but I do not give lessons in using resource
editors, sorry.  This is because I'd have to make separate "tutorials"
for each resource editor, and I just don't have the time.

You can of course edit the .flm files; check out my tutorials on Filmstrip
editing if you want to know how.

For Babyz:
==========

Things are a little different in this game, but the principle is the
same.  We have several set playscenes and a variety of objects which
are always in a given scene but never in a cupboard -- such as the big 
teddy in the playroom or the high chair in the kitchen.  Then there are
toyz which are always to be seen in a specific cupboard or closet in
a specific room.  Finally there are some toyz which were presumably
never meant to be seen, such as the "surprise" box which, in Petz 4,
contains the bubble machine but in Babyz does not even appear in the
game and is empty when you "enable" it.  Because so many positions
need to be taken into account, the numbers which we need to change
are a little more complicated, but don't panic -- it's still pretty
simple once you get your mind around it.  The thing to remember is that
because of all the possible positions, Babyz makes use of an 8-byte
set of hex numbers.  (actually, the Petz games probably do too, but
since they don't tend to make use of position it doesn't affect hexers)
Most of the numbers in the 8-byte identifiers of the Babyz toyz etc are 
still 00, and the main object ID is still the first two, but there are 
some important differences.

Here are some examples, which I hope will show you how to find the ID
number as well as illustrate the way it works:

Attic Cupboard: 
Example: Watering can, 

00034224 0000 0000 5761 7465 7269 6E67 2043 616E ....Watering Can
00034240 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 ................
00034256 0000 0000 5C27 0000 0300 0400 0000 0000 ....\'..........

The words Watering Can are near the ID number, and searching for them is
a neat way of getting to the place that you're after.

The number is 5C27 0000 0300 0400
5C27 is the individual ID, 0300 0400 indicates its base location. 
In this case, the base location is the attic shelves.
You don't have to worry about the fact that the watering can is also in the garden, 
as this is caused by code within the playscene.

Playroom cupboard: 
example, Rattle, 

00038128 0000 0000 5261 7474 6C65 0000 0000 0000 ....Rattle......
00038144 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 ................
00038160 0000 0000 4D27 0000 8310 0000 0000 0000 ....M'..........

number is 4D27 0000 8310 0000
4D27 is its individual ID number, and 8310 0000 indicates its base location.
In this case, the base location is the playroom cupboard.

Dressingroom diaper-cupboard: 
Example: Intercom, 

00037728 0000 0000 496E 7465 7263 6F6D 0000 0000 ....Intercom....
00037744 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 ................
00037760 0000 0000 3527 0000 0340 0000 0000 0000 ....5'...@......

number is 3527 0000 0340 0000
3527 is its individual ID number, and 0340 0000 indicates its base location.
In this case, the base location is the dressing-room diaper-cupboard.

Nursery: 
Example: Toy book, 

00034896 0000 0000 546F 7920 426F 6F6B 0000 0000 ....Toy Book....
00034912 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 ................
00034928 0000 0000 4127 0000 A300 0100 0000 0000 ....A'..........

has number 4127 0000 A300 0100
4127 is the Toy Book's individual ID, and A300 0100 indicates its base location.

Now here's an interesting pair that you might want to fool around with...
Sittingroom:
Example: Record,

00041952 0000 0000 5265 636F 7264 0000 0000 0000 ....Record......
00041968 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 ................
00041984 0000 0000 4F27 0000 A300 0200 0000 0000 ....O'..........

has ID number 4F27, and A300 0200 indicates its base location.

Example: Record Player,

00046304 0000 0000 5265 636F 7264 2050 6C61 7965 ....Record Playe
00046320 7200 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 r...............
00046336 0000 0000 4E27 0000 8300 0000 0000 0000 ....N'..........

has ID number 4E27, and 8300 0000 indicates its base location.

Now then, the two items above can be made to work in other playscenes.
For instance, change the Record Player so that it still has the 83, but
change the 00 after it to 10 so that it shows up on the Playroom shelf.
It now becomes 8310 0000 and will appear as usual in the sittingroom,
but you can also get it out in the playroom.  Now take the Record.toy
and give it that 10 number too -- i.e. change its number to 4F27 0000 A310

Next time you open the game, you can get the player and the record off the
shelf and have your baby dance in the playroom.  You can leave the record
playing in there and then go to the sitting-room, and put on another record
there too; go back to the playroom and the first one is still playing.
A caution here, sometimes when you try to pick the record off the shelf
the hand appears with nothing in it.  Actually the key here seems to be hidden 
in your game's Registry, where you need to have the first "slot" filled in
the name of a record that's in your Songz directory.  For some reason the
first slot is often empty.  You can fix this by playing a record in the
sittingroom, then running Regedit.exe and navigating via the little crosses
on the left to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\PF.Magic\Babyz\1.00.00
then on the right-hand side scrolling down until you see RECORD 101's Song File
(it may be RECORD <any other number>'s Song File, but I'm sure you get the idea).
This one will probably have nothing but 00 numbers next to it if you're having
problems grabbing the record off the playroom shelf.

If you've played any records in the game, some of the slots will have more than
just 00 00 00 numbers in them.  Double-click on one of those and a little hex
editor will pop up.  Select everything in there and choose copy and close the
little editor.  Now double-click on that first one and select everything in
there and choose Paste and OK.  Close Regedit.  After this, you should be able
always to get the record off the shelf -- if not, repeat the process with any
other empty Record slots in the Babyz registry.

Here are some items that are set to show up in a kitchen cupboard:

00034160 0000 0000 4D69 6C6B 2042 6F74 746C 6500 ....Milk Bottle.
00034176 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 ................

00038816 0000 0000 2027 0000 8380 0000 5370 7269 .... '......Spri

The location number is of course 8380 0000.  Also in the kitchen cupboard
is a medicine bottle, but you can see from the location number (0304 0000):

00037632 0000 0000 4D65 6469 6369 6E65 2042 6F74 ....Medicine Bot
00037648 746C 6500 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 tle.............
00037664 0000 0000 3A27 0000 0340 0000 0000 0000 ....:'...@......

that its base position is the diaper-cupboard, so you can be pretty sure that
the game has used some other way of making it appear also in the kitchen.

Hidden items, or itemns that you can't get off the shelf anywhere:
---------------------------------------
playroom, big teddy, has number 2827 0000 8100 0000
Its individual ID number is 2827, and 8100 0000 means it's not on the shelf, 
so it is effectively "hidden" to the cupboards. 

00034112 0000 0000 4269 6720 5465 6464 7920 4265 ....Big Teddy Be

00034144 0000 0000 2827 0000 8100 0000 0000 0000 ....('..........

Kitchen, High chair, has number 3427 0000 0100 0000
3427 is its individual ID number, and 0100 0000 means it is effectively 
"hidden" to the cupboards, or has no place there.  If you change its
"position" number to 8380 0000 you might expect to find it in the food 
cupboard under the sink, but unfortunately it does not have an "on the
shelf" action, so it will be invisible and will crash the game if you
try to get it out, unless you provide it with an on-the-shelf animation.

00042944 0000 0000 4869 6768 2043 6861 6972 0000 ....High Chair..
00042960 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 ................
00042976 0000 0000 3427 0000 0100 0000 0000 0000 ....4'..........

I have given my version of the High Chair an on-shelf animation, so by
all means use that if you want to make others of your own.  The method
for adding these animations, or .flh/.flm sections is the same as in the
Petz 3 and 4 games; you can either add them to a subdirectory of your hard
drive:

\art\sprites\toyz\<sprite name> (for instance, in the case of my Catty
the <sprite name> would be Catty_X2, and if I'd wanted to have the 
filmstrips external, \art\sprites\toyz\Catty_X2
is where I'd have put them)

here are some which show up in the playscenes only, not on a shelf:

Now, you can change the ID numbers of these so that they would show up on
the shelf in the Playroom or the Attic, just as with others, but the originals 
don't have the on-shelf filmstrip.  As mentioned above, you can give them suitable 
filmstrips either by using a resource editor as I have with some of them, or you 
can give them filmstrips by placing suitable .flh and .flm files in a subdirectory 
on your hard drive.  The advantage of the latter method is that you can swap
them around with other suitable flh/flm pairs any time you want without messing
around with the toy file.  The disadvantage is that people passing your toyz
around amongst themselves will inevitably forget to include these separate files.

Incidentally it just so happens that you can make things show up on the Playroom
_and_ Attic shelves by putting in the relevant positional numbers for both.  They
just happen not to overwrite each other :-)

Addendum: How to make new toyz work separately
================================================

In all the games you need to give any toyz which are not to overwrite the originals
their own ID numbers.  You already should know from the above how to find the ID 
number.  What you need to change is the 2-byte number which comes before the
bytes that tell the game whether it's hidden or not.  For instance, in the case
of the Petz hermit crab, the ID is 2B27.  Change either 2B or 27 or both to some
hexadecimal number which does not clash with another toy in your game.  Note that
the game won't accept just any number for toyz or clothes, so you'll have to try
numbers for yourself to see which ones work.

Also, when you have the original in the game also and take it as well as a new item 
hexed from it off the shelf, the two will look the same.  You need to separate them.
You do that by changing all the "pointers".  There are three areas in which you should 
to do this.  Let's take the Blue Picture Frame, which is in all the games.  The
example below is mostly for a Petz one, but the same principle applies in Babyz:

The "pointer" is Sprite_Pict_B1

Up here there are two instances (in Petz):

And eureka!  Your picture frame and the original will come out as they
are supposed to :-)

Another note, for Babyz hexers.  I'm using here as an example a problem
which Dani, who is making beautiful Babyz books, sent to me.  She had
done the ID number correctly, and the redirecting, and the book showed
up fine on the shelf.  However, when she took either her book, which
she had called simply Book.toy, or the original Alphabet book, off the
shelf, the other one disappeared.  This was caused by something which
Babyz hexers have taken for granted, but which Petz hexers cannot get
away with, as I show here:

The real name of the Book inside is actually the same as the name of the 
Alphabet Book.  In breedfiles etc for Petz, people are used to the fact that 
it is essential to re-name the file inside as well as outside; in Babyz people
have learned to be lazy because the game actually allows us a lot more
leeway.  We're used to doing the ID number thing, hexers are even
beginning to understand about the _X1 etc thing, but people often forget
to rename properly.

To make your book show up separately, you need to change the name.  It's
best to change things in the following three places:

Note where I put the extra 00 bytes in each case to make up for the
removal of all those letters which make up Alphabet, and note that in
the last section I changed the letter-count in front of each name to 04
instead of 0D.

Your book and the Alphabet book can now be brought out at the same time.

Enjoy
