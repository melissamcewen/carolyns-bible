Okay, the key is in the [Default Scales].

In the Mutt, look for

[Default Scales]
150     normal pet scale
145     normal ball scale

this is for the adult.  Try changing the "150" to "100" and the "145" to
" 95" (notice the space in  95, to make up for the number being one
character shorter).

and for the puppy:

[Default Scales];adult 150 145
98      normal pet scale
115     normal ball scale

Try changing the "98" to "58" and the "115" to " 75" (once again, notice
that you need the space in  75, to make up for the shorter number).

Another example; Using the Dachschund, up at the top of the .lnz section we
have the defaults for the fully-grown adult:

[Default Scales]
120     normal pet scale
125     normal ball scale

And at the bottom of the .lnz, below ; Dachshund puppy, we have for the
basic puppy size (as it comes out of the Adoption Cantre:

[Default Scales];adult 150 145
75      normal pet scale
100     normal ball scale

ignore ;adult 150 145, it does nothing and is inaccurate anyway; that's
just a programmer's note.  You can change the sizes of puppy/kitten and
adult separately -- make for instance a huge pup and a tiny adult -- by
changing the numbers 120 and 125 downwards by the same amount and the
numbers 75 and 100 upwards by the same amount.  If you want weird
effects (including a bloated look or a pop-eyed "skeleton" effect), just
change those two numbers in each section relative to each other.
Altering the normal pet scale and normal ball scale by different amounts
alters the basic underlying shape of the breed.

The only breed that seems more complicated is the Poodle, but mini-poodles
can also be easily created simply by changing all the [Default Scales].
