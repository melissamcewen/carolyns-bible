Slant legs on Dogz
===================

I keep being asked about this, so I thought everyone
 would like to know the answer to "how do I put slant legs on dogz?"

Angling legs in Dogz is pretty simple; just move the various leg 
and foot ballz, under the [Move] section.  but you want to be careful 
not to overdo it.  For instance, in the slant-leg, down-tail variation 
of my Sarans German Shepherd, I've got this, which I think looks good 
in poses _and_ in the game:

;knee		
16, 	-7, 	 9,	-5
40, 	7, 	 9,	-2
;ankle
0,	-7, 	-10,	8 
24,	7, 	-2,	5 
;feet 
12,	-7,	0,	20
36,	7,	0,	20
;toes   
20,	-7,	0,	19
21,	-7,	0,	19
22,	-7,	0,	19
44,	7,	0,	19
45,	7,	0,	19
46,	7,	0,	19
;butt
49,	0,	20,	0
;hips
19, 	0, 	20,	-7
43, 	0, 	20,	-7

But if you do it so that, for instance, the z co-ordinate is set too far 
back, the dog's legs can fling out alarmingly when it runs.

As a side note, I've also got a drop tail variation in that breedfile, to 
go with the slant legs, and if you check out the file you can see how I 
did that particular one.


Round Ears On Catz similar to my Dogz Tyger
===========================================

You can change the position of the ears in [Move] to something like:

9,	-8, 0, -20
11,	8, 0, -20	
8,	18, -25, -5 
10,	-18, -25, -5 

and then remove any Add Ballz that you don't want (listing them in [Omissions]  
is a good way).  You might want to keep and change a couple of [Add Ballz] so 
that they give ballz 8 and 10 a kind of outline and back -- the simplest would 
be a large ball, say size 60, at position 0, 0, 8 relative to the base balls 8 
and 10.  Then you'd want to make sure that ballz 8 and 9, 10 and 11 are joined 
in [Linez].  I believe that I just used a simple outline in my dogz Tyger; I 
think it depends on your own preferences, but you may find that the colour won't 
go to 2nd-gens if you use the outline method.  

Happy hexing
