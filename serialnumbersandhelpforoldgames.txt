
People write to me, asking about serial numbers for the old petz games and
asking how to get the games to run on XP or ME or some system that I don't have.
So here are a couple of handy links for you:

The whole thing with serial numbers is a pain, but UbiSoft have serial numbers 
for all the older games up at their help pages:
http://ubisoft.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/ubisoft.cfg/php/enduser/std_alp.php
Enter Dogz Serial or Catz Serial in the "search text" box and it should produce 
what you want.

If you have troubles running the game on a modern system, you might find help 
there also, or try Daniel Wright's page of info about petz games and system requirements:
http://www.dmwright.com/oddpetz/
on his System Requirements link.

Good luck
