
For people who want to be able to make all males come out of the 
AC, or all females, or to make a particular variation always one
gender...

Add this to the .lnz file if you want breed to be all male:

[Force To Male]
1

if you want it all female:

[Force To Female]
1

If variation #2.A is to be male but #1 female:

[Force To Male]
#2.A
1
#1
0
##
[Force To Female]
#2.A
0
#1
1
##

If variation #2.A is to be male but #1 can be either:

[Force To Male]
#2.A
1
#1
0
##

One point to remember -- these words in brackets have to be very
specific indeed.  Remember, they are commands for the game to pick 
up on and so they _must_ be exact.  For instance

[Force To Male]

will work

[Force to Male]

will not.

Enjoy!
