=================================

Okay, you had a stuck pregnancy and the baby was finally born at 
some ridiculously impossible date such as 1980 or 2037.  It irritates 
you every time you look at the pet's profile.  Well, you can actually 
find and edit that date, but it'll probably drive you potty trying to 
work it out exactly.

Remember that as always with editing .pet files, you will need to 
compensate for any increase or decrease by decreasing or increasing  
something else.  In the case of the family tree data, the easiest way 
to compensate is to alter letters in the adopter's name, but you may 
want to find some other place to do it.  Just take care, you can 
corrupt the file if you choose the wrong place to do your compensatory 
changes.

First of all, as always -- remember to keep a backup copy of any pet 
that you are about to edit.  Corruptions can occur all too easily.  
Now open the petfile in the hex editor and search for PfMaGiCpEtZIII 
-- exactly that, upper and lower case letters.  This is where the 
family-tree and adoption data lies; you should see your pet's name and 
yours in the area after those letters.

Now this is where, as always, it gets a bit tricky to explain...  you 
want the part which lies after the name of the adopter.  I can best 
explain by showing an extract from one of my pets.  Remember that the 
positioning of PfMaGiCpEtZIII and most of the bytes in this area will 
be different to varying degrees in your own particular pet.  

I'll do the simplest thing first; a 1st-gen pet which you might want 
to change because your computer clock was set wrongly when you adopted 
(a common occurrence when fast-forwarding, LOL). This pet was adopted 
on February 4, 2004:

00009BE0 4010 C430 4000 0000 0050 664D 6147 6943 @..0@....PfMaGiC

00009C30 796E 231B 2140 0000 0000 0100 0000 0100 yn#.!@..........

There's the pet name, then the breed name, then mine.  See the four 
bytes directly after my name there?  Those are what give the pet its 
date.    The last two -- 2140 -- are the main two; change the 40 by 
one to make it 41 and the date shifts by several months, to August 16 2004.  
If you change it to 42 instead, you'll get several more months -- 
February 27, 2005.  Change the 21 to 22 instead of changing that 40, 
and you get February 5, 2004.  Change it to 23, and you get February 6, 2004.  
Get the idea?  If you change the 21 to 23 and the 40 to 42, you get 
February 28 2005; yes, I know it seems as if it should be February 29 
or March 1 (since it's not a Leap Year), but it isn't.  This is where 
your fine-tuning numbers come in, which are the first two (231B in this 
example), and you need to change them quite a lot to make only a small 
difference in the date.

Before you ask, I don't have a list of dates -- I've not been interested 
enough to try and figure out a whole load of dates, so you'll have to do 
a lot of trial and error yourself.  

Now then, let's tackle the problem of a 2nd-gen or later born on the wrong date.  
You need to go to the same place in the file, still looking for the 
PfMaGiCpEtZIII then the baby pet's name, breed and name of owner at time 
of birth.

00008AA0 0000 0000 0000 0100 0000 0000 0000 0050 ...............P
00008AB0 664D 6147 6943 7045 745A 4949 4900 4B3D fMaGiCpEtZIII.K=
00008AC0 443C 4233 D23E 90FD D711 89B0 0000 1CD7 D<B3.>..........

00008AE0 6F6F 646C 6504 0000 0046 6172 6100 0000 oodle....Fara...

00008B10 7363 6172 0900 0000 4461 6368 7368 756E scar....Dachshun

This time, the date has shifted away from the owner's name by 4 bytes.  
The first four bytes in this case, after Fara's name, are 0000 0000 but 
they may have some other number in there in your petfile.  The numbers 
which make up the date are the next four, in this example 2A 2B6D 41 
which happens to be October 13, 2004.  Wups.  It should be some date 
in September 2003 to make any sense.  Well, I change the 41 to 3F -- 
that should get me into 2003 at about the right area, and I compensate 
for the decrease by increasing one of those two "fine-tune" bytes by 2:

00008AF0 002C 2B6D 3F02 0000 0000 01E7 DECE 7C8C .,+m?.........|.

Okay, I run the game.  Bingo!  September 21, 2003!

So there you have it.  The latest member of the family has its date 
after the first 4 bytes after your name, and all the other family 
members have their dates directly after the owner's name as with 1st-gens.

Enjoy!
