

This zipfile contains a family of Bunnies; the parents were
adopted from the original P.F.Magic breedfile and therefore had been
"spayed" by default.  I have un-spayed them and successfully bred from
them; you can see that they are Jassil's parents if you look at the
family history.

For more on breeding bunniez and pigz, and un-spaying pets, see my
pig and Bunny breeding packs and my pet hexing tutorial.

Enjoy
