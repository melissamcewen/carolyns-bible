
I've been asked a few times now how to add textures to eyes.  Well,
there are a few different ways, all of which involve using the eye ball
itself as the iris, instead of the iris ball outline.  Here are a couple
of my favourites:

Method 1 -- with a white eyeball
=============================

Make the iris balls, together with their outlines, all colour 244 and small
enough to look like pupils only.  You may find this easier to control if you 
list the iris ballz under [Omissions] and use a pair of [Add Ball] ballz, 

14 0 0 0 244 244 0 0 0 -1 13 8 0 4 -1
38 0 0 0 244 244 0 0 0 -1 13 8 0 4 -1

which you would then list under [Eyes]

[Eyes]
32, 8			RightEye/leftEye
<your add ball no.>,<your add ball no.>	RightIris/leftIris

Now make your eye ball colour the colour that you wish yout pet's iris to be
and make the eye ball outline colour 245.  Give it an otlntTyp of 5 and sizeDif 
of -4, say, for a Great Dane.  You can then use a texture.  You can also use
[Paint Ballz] if you wish.

Method 2 -- with a coloured eyeball, closer to real life
=================================================

I like this one best of all, and it's the one which I used to make the two
petz in the accompanying downloadable zipfile.  Once again, my size examples
are for a Great Dane.  You may need to tweak them for other breedz.

For the game's iris ballz 14 and 38, make them otlntTyp 1 and sizeDif -3.
Make both of their ball and outline colours 244.  Fuzz -1 of course unless
you want a slight fuzziness.

For the game's eye ballz 8 and 32, set the ball colour to the colour you
want the iris.  Set the outline colour to 244, and Fuzz -1.  otlntTyp 2 
and sizeDif -3.  Texture of your choice.  Of course you can change any of
these, they are just what I like.

My example petz each have a green eye and a blue eye; one pet has them textured 
with the hair6 "brindle" effect, and the other with the hay.bmp which you'll find 
in the game's Resource\Wallpaper directory.  If you set the "flag" for the hay.bmp 
to 90, your colour will show through in a way that _I_ like anyway :-)
If that sounded like double-dutch to you, take a look at my LNZ file
breakdown chunks where I talk about the [Texture List], or one of my other
howtos.

Oh, and you can add paint ballz to this also if you wish -- the eye ball allows
paint but the iris does not.

Happy hexing
