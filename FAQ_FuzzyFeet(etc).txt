Change the numbers for fuzz in the [Ballz Info] section, in the Fuzz column.
This alters the fuzziness/fluffines of the adults in any breedfile.  You
may also wish to change the numbers, in the same section, in the sizeDiff
column.

Note that some breedz have also extra tail ballz etc in [Add Ballz]. You may
wish to change the numbers in the fuzz and ballsize columns there also, for
specific added ballz (such as tail ballz in Great Danes).

If the Fuzzification isn't enough, or is too much, or doesn't show up at 
all in a puppy or kitten, change the sizes under the 
[Ball Size Override].  For example:

0, 20
24, 20
31, 20
7, 20
16, 20
40, 20
12, 30
13, 30
36, 30
37, 30
23, 20
47, 20

The first column is the ball number, the second column the size.  This
would be what you would want to change to make the feet, hands, wrists
etc smaller or bigger.  Then, with the fuzz, I don't recommend using a
number greater than 9:

[Fuzz Override]
0, 9
24, 9
31, 9
7, 9
16, 9
40, 9
12, 9
13, 9
36, 9
37, 9
23, 9
47, 9


Hope that helps
