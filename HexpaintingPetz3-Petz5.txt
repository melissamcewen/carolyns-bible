"HEX-PAINTING"
==============

People keep asking me for a hex painting tutorial.  I can't think why;
the only difference between hex-painting and hex editing is that you
don't rename the breed or make it show up separately in the Adoption
Centre.  You still need a hex editor -- or, better, my easy-edit
packages -- and you still need to edit the .LNZ part of the breedfile
exactly as you do for hex editing.  But here it is anyway...

Hex-painting is done in order to adopt pets, and "litters" of pets,
which have unusual characteristics but which will run using the standard
P.F.Magic breedfiles.  Any pets adopted from a "hex-painted" breedfile
are supposed to be able to pass their colour characteristics on into the
general gene-pool, although changes in shape etc aren't likely to carry
on through generations unless you provide the edited overwriting
breedfile or .LNZ along with the pet.

You will need to keep backup copies of any breedfile that you're going
to edit, of course, and once you've finished making litters from the
edited version you can delete it by copying the original one back over
it.  If you mess up and have forgotten to back up the breed, you may be
able to find replacements at sites such as APKC or Daniel Wright's
archive.

You will only be changing things in the .LNZ section of the breedfile,
because any changed bitmaps and sounds inside the breedfile won't be
there in anyone else's breeds.  Also of course you don't want to change
the breed name or it won't run with a standard breed.

When you come to the textures, if you're going to change the furfile
bitmap it _has_ to be external to the breedfile, and you'll have to
change the texture list to point to where it is (e.g.
\resource\catz\wibble.bmp).  Remember that if you're sending people pets
from a hex-painted litter which uses such furfiles, you'll have to send
them a copy of the furfile also and tell them what subdirectory to put
it in (if relevant).

You need a hex editor or easy-edit kit (and useful tools)
========================================

First, try my easy-edit kits.  They are downloadable from my site and,
if you read the readmes and install them properly, the only thing you'll
need to use for editing is Notepad!

If you don't use the easy-edit kits, you'll have to use a hex editor at
least some of the time.  If you don't have one, there are loads of them
available for download, and they all do the same basic tasks, although
some of them have complicated "bells and whistles" too for power-users. 
You can get various freeware ones, such as: 
Hexedit, from
http://www.okinfoweb.com/moe/files/hexedit.zip 
Hexedit (yes, same name, different program) from
http://www-physics.mps.ohio-state.edu/~prewett/hexedit/index.html
Axe, available from some of the simtelnet mirrors but hard to get and
so, at the time of writing this, you can also download Axe from my site.

If none of these suit you, do an Internet search (using one of the
online search engines such as Google or Yahoo) for "hexedit" and
"freeware".  All of them are pretty straightforward to install, I
think.  Then, if you have the shortcut to your chosen one on your
desktop, you can drag-and-drop any file you want to investigate onto
it.  They all show files in a similar way: there are three sections, the
left-hand one being the "Address" section and containing numbers which
show which byte you're looking at (in Hex numbers usually), and it
starts at 00.  The middle section is the meat of the thing, being the
actual data of the file shown as hexadecimal numbers.  The right-hand
side shows the file itself also, but in this case as raw ASCII so that
you see it as a mix of weird symbols or dots and text.  Most of the time
you will be looking at that right-hand section in order to find or
fiddle with bits of text.

It is possible of course to edit breedfiles etc (_not_ petfiles!) in a
modern-day Windows Resource Editor such as the one at
http://www.users.on.net/johnson/resourcehacker/ which is fine, as you
get to see the .LNZ file the way it's supposed to be and, as opposed to
using a hex editor for the job, you don't have to keep the file size
always the same.  The down side is that Resource Hacker re-compiles the
file each time you make changes, and eventually it often corrupts.

If you prefer, you can use a program called Vim.  You will probably
need to download Vim from the maker's site and figure out how to use it
yourself.  I'm afraid I can't help you with that.

Other useful tools
------------------

Notepad.exe -- came with Windows.  Used for editing .LNZ files if you do
it my way.  

Mspaint.exe -- came with Windows; you might want it (or a paint package
of your choice) to edit Furfiles.

Editing breedfiles (the actual "painting")
==========================================

Before you start editing your breedfile to make your hex-painted litter,
make sure that you have a copy of the original somewhere safe.  Also
keeping copies of the new breed as you go along is no bad thing.

Another thing to remember if you're using a hex editor -- and this is
important -- is that the breedfile must be exactly the same size after
you've finished.  You can see what size the file is at any time by
right-clicking on it in Windows Explorer and choosing "properties".

The basics of editing are the same whether you start with a .DOG breed
or a .CAT breed; the only real difference is in the ballz numbers.  I
include lists for both types later in this document.

It's a good idea to start with a P.F.Magic original when you edit,
rather than an already-hexed breed; this is because some people remove
whole areas, replacing them often with spaces, which you might want to
retain.  Also some people, such as myself, do some pretty strange
experimenting and you could end up with results that puzzle you because
some small already-changed item escapes your notice.  This is not to say
you shouldn't learn from others' work -- of course you should!  But with
the technique I use (described below) it's an easy matter to take out
the core of a hexed breedfile and examine it for ideas and techniques
which you can then use.

Okay, either open your .LNZ into Notepad or open your breedfile into
your chosen editor, and let's on with the editing!  I shall use the
Persian Cat file as example unless otherwise stated: remember, the other
cat and dog files are very similar, and they all follow the same
structure.

THE MAIN PART OF THE BREED; THE SIZE, SHAPE, ETC
------------------------------------------------

This is the core of the breed; the .LNZ file which makes up the kind of
creature it is. In the case of the Persian it starts with 

; persian

and continues down to

(c) 1997 PF. Magic, Inc.  Lets not talk about me

Now, this is actually an area of ordinary ASCII text (letters and
numbers).  You'll probably want to do lots of editing here...  There are
three ways of doing this.  Either laboriously go through it, byte by
byte, in the hex editor; many people used to do that with Petz 2 and
Petz 3 breedfiles.  Or, if you're familiar with Vim, you can edit it
pretty quickly; the drawback is that you have to be familiar with Vim's
quirks.  A lot of people these days use Resource Hacker; if you do that,
and get corruptions or crashes, ask around on the various forums for
help or go back to previous versions and start again from there.

Or, if you like using Notepad, just open the .LNZ from one of my
easy-edit packages into Notepad, edit and save.  

If you're doing it the way I used to, with internal .LNZ files, then
copy out the whole area from "; persian" to "Lets not talk about me"
into a new file in the hex editor, save it as a .txt file, edit it in
Notepad, and re-save it in the right place in the breedfile in your hex
editor.  I still do that when I've finalised a breed with one of my
external-lnz easy-edit files, if I want to make a new breed
downloadable.  But since you're just hex-painting, there's no need to do
that unless you want to distribute the breedfile for breeders.

I use the Notepad methods because I'm comfortable with them.  These days
I use the external easy-edit packages more often than the internal-lnz
Notepad method, as I'm getting less time to make full new breedz. 
_Don't_ use Wordpad or any more sophisticated program such as Word to
edit the .lnz, as that can put in hidden characters that you don't want.

.LNZ files inside the breedfile are actually two .LNZ files -- adult and
kit or pup -- and you need to be aware of this when editing because
changes to the adult .lnz don't always show up at the Adoption Centre
unless you've made the changes also to the pup or kitten .lnz.  There
are two special cases, the Alley Cat and the Poodle, which have two
"RAW" .lnz files also.  These are a form of variation which only have an
effect when the petz breed, so you may want to hex them to be identical
to the breedz' normal two .lnz files.

The following extracts are given assuming that you are using Notepad;
the sections will look different to you in a Hex editor, because you
won't see them as columns, just a constant wrap-around stream of letters
and numbers.  

What can you change?  Well, fiddle around with most things and see what
happens.  Take a look at my .LNZ file breakdown chunks, available at my
site, if you want to get an understanding of what each item is and how
it can be changed.  All I'm showing you here is a rough guide.

[Default Linez File]
\ptzfiles\cat\catmaster.lnz

This contains data which is common to all cat breedz.  You can insert
the items which are in the "catmaster.lnz" file into your own breed's
.LNZ and alter them there -- those changes will take precedence over the
originals in the catmaster.lnz file, but you still nee to point to a
[Default Linez File].  In dogz of course it's dogmaster.lnz.

[Little one]
prkit.lnz

This points to the pup or kitten .lnz.  you can actually change that so
that it points to itself by putting pr.lnz there instead; it's useful
for a quick look at what the adult will be like, because it will come
out of the AC fully grown.

[Breed Name]
Persian

This doesn't actually seem to have much effect.  Then there's

[Sounds]
\ptzfiles\cat\pr\prsnd.txt

If you change this, you will end up with a silent breed unless you point
deliberately to a list of sounds that you have edited.  If you do that,
you will need to distribute the sounds with the pet, which you wouldn't
want to do for hex-painted petz.

Everything else is open to change, and you can get some pretty
spectacular results even just changing the [Head Enlargement], [Face
Extension] etc.  Experiment with relative sizes and lengths, including
minus numbers.

The eyelid colour is up here, separate from the main ballz Info section,
so it's here that you will have to change it if you wish:

[256 Eyelid Color]
18, 1

Things like the various [Move] sections and the [Project Ball] section
can be messed with, though some caution is needed if you want to keep
the thing looking reasonably sane...  *thinks a moment about some of the
breedz I've hexed*...  Awww heck, who needs sanity?  *Cackles madly*

[Project Ball]  // stationary ball, projected ball, amt

There are three columns.  The first is the ball to which another is
going to relate -- it's the ball which will remain "stationary" -- and
the second is the ball which is going to project from it by a certain
amount, the third column being that amount.  Because it uses one ball to
steady another and keep it in the same relative distance, I tend to call
this "anchoring".  I believe that has confused people in the past.

[Move]

Now, this section is very important to hexers and is often used in
conjunction with [Project Ball] to get things like tail shapes right.

The first column is the ball number.  The next three columns are the x,
y, z axes to which you want your ballz to be  moved relative to the
defaults.  If there is a fifth column, then that is the ball to which
this move should be relative.  So 14,  4, -3, -5  14 would mean that you
want ball 14 to be moved sideways by 4, up by 3, and forward by 5
relative to its normal position.

This fifth column is also useful in helping to keep a ball "anchored";
it's not as firm as when you use the [Project Ball] distances as well--
for instance, angled legs in dogz breedz can throw out strangely if you
don't keep them in place with a [Project Ball] "tie" -- but it does help
to keep balls from behaving strangely.  This [Move] thing will at least
keep your ballz as intended relative to the "relative" ball.

If, say, you want your elbows to stay relevant to the shoulders, you 
do your xyz move for the elbows thus, in a catz breed:

12, <x>, <y>, <z>, 38
13, <x>, <y>, <z>, 39

in a dogz breed of course that would be:

7, <x>, <y>, <z>, 18
31, <x>, <y>, <z>, 42

Note, you'd have numbers where I've got <x>, <y>, <z> in the above
example,
of course!  

Back to our Persian.  Here's an important section:

[Default Scales];was 113 113
105             ; normal pet scale
105             ; normal ball scale

If you change these numbers, you can make the whole creature either
larger or smaller, and if the pet scale is vastly different from the
ball scale some startling effects can occur.

For the next sections of interest -- the [Add Ball] and [Linez] ones --
it's best to have a list of ballz and their numbers handy, so I prepared
a list earlier which you should find at the end of this tutorial.
You will find that, as your hexing gets more complicated, that you'll
have to keep counting your [Add Ball] lines of code yourself to find
out which ball has which ball number.

[Add Ball]

The Addballz are the key to the problems some people have with
ear-colours.  This section can look a bit confusing, but actually it's
all logical really.  Usually you don't have to alter these, but there
may be times when you want to make sure that, for instance, the colour
of the extra ear ballz fit that of your new breed's ears in the main
[Ballz Info section], or you may want them to be a different size or
different shape.

Most of the columns in the Addballz are pretty obvious:

base x y z color otlnCol spckCol fuzz group outline ballsize bodyarea
addGroup texture

but the first four can be a bit muddling until you get used to them.  It
works if you think of "base" as being the base reference for the ball
you're working with, and the x,y,z values would then be the distance
from that in the three dimensions.  So:

; ### From here down are animator's addballz 77.
;nose
37,     5,      -5,     -8, etc
37,     -5,     -5,     -8, etc
37,     0,      0,      -8, etc

would mean that ball 77, with the normal nose ball 37 as its base, is
offset from it by x; 5, y; -5, z; -8, that ball 78 is offset from its
base (also ball 37) by x; -5, y; -5, z; -8, and that ball 79 is offset
from its base (yet again ball 37) by x; 0, y; 0, z; -8.

Many people get confused by [Add Ball] ballz when they come to joining
them up with Linez, not realising that it's where the ball is in [Add
Ball] that gives it its ball number.  So the first of those nose balls
above is ball number 77, the next one is ball number 78, and so on. 

Note that "texture" refers to the list of textures at the beginning of
the [Ballz Info] section, and that 0 is the first texture in the list, 1
the second etc -- with -1 meaning no texture.

[Linez]

Linez also are pretty straightforward really, and you'll normally not
want to bother with them unless you're making a pet with complex extra
ballz, or one which is an unusual shape.  They are the lines which
connect two ballz together, and this section lets you fool around with
the amount of fuzz, the colours, and the thickness of the edges:
start ball, end ball, fuzz, colour, lfColour, rtColour, sThck (thickness
of one side), eThick (thickness of the other side).  As it states above
the table, "-1 mean use the associated ball color", so if you want the
linez to be the same colours as you've got for the ballz, -1 should be
okay.  Incidentally, it actually means the colour of the first ball in 
the Linez line connecting the two ballz, so if your two balls are of
different colours, watch out for that.

[Paint Ballz]

Now, here's a section which is missed by some people; the [Paint Ballz]
section.  In this, the paw pads for each breed are shown in detail for
just about every breed; however, this is also where you can find the
Dalmatian's spots and the Calico cat's patches, and of course these can
be changed.  The columns are:

base ball diameter(% of baseball) direction color outlinecolor fuzz outline group texture

Once again, pretty straightforward, the first column referring to the
part of the paw for which the section of pad is being made (or the ball
to which the spot is to be added).  The "direction" is in the form of 
a relative x,y,z as with the animator's addballz.  What you need to
remember with a Paint ballz, though, is that if you have it situated at
position 0,0,0, the game will not know what to do -- it can't put a blob
of paint in the centre of the ball and have it whow up on the surface!
This is when you get a pet with mysterious black blobs suddenly appearing
where they shouldn't.  So be sensible when designing Paint Ballz.

When you see lines that start with #, don't panic.  Those are
variations.  If you want a variety of different pets to come out of the
AC with your breedfile, then you would be best to study variations and
understand them.  If you don't want any complications, just remove all
the variations.

So now we come, in most breedz, to the section which looks like this in
the Persian:

[Color Info Override]
;individual variation
#4
#3
#2;blue
3, 115
2, 115
6, 115

Okay, this is pretty simple really -- the first column is the ball
number and the second is the colour.  

If you want variations, as I say above, don't go removing those lines
which start with #, but you can change everything in this section and
even add more variations.  Once again, see my .LNZ breakdown chunks and
my howtos on variations if you want to make good use of them.   You can
have a lot of different colours available within your breedfile if you
wish.  Don't feel bound to stick only with the balls which are actually
listed in this section, either -- you can add in any ball for which you
want to allow a variation in colour, and you can add in extra variations
also.

The next section is

[Thin/Fat]
4,      -15,    16
5,      -15,    16

This is a way of defining how fat or thin your pet will be able to get.

Then we get:

[Head Shot];pr
0                       frame number
51                              rotation
0                               roll
0                               tilt
-51                             head rotation
8                               head tilt
-11                             head cock
38, 38                  R / L eyelid height
17, 17                  R / L eyelid tilt
0, 0                    (X, Y) eye target

This is simply to do with what the picture of your pet looks like when
you see its picture at the Adoption Centre or the carry-case.

[Ballz Info]

Next comes the part which is familiar to all Petz 2 or Petz 3 hexers;
the [Ballz Info] section, where the breed's main ballz sizes, colours,
fuzz etc can be changed to great effect.  First come the bitmaps:

; First argument is name of texture.
; Second argument is whether texture is single color (1) or multi-color (0)
; This texture list is used both here and in add ballz
[Texture List]
\art\textures\hair10.bmp        1
\art\textures\hair10.bmp        1
\art\textures\hair10.bmp        1

In Petz 5, all the textures are in the main Resource .dll file.
In Petz 3 and Petz 4, most breedz (apart from Maine Coon and Tabby cats 
and poodle dog), have their textures in the main Resource .dll file.
The textures, which are in the subdirectory \art\textures\, is tucked away
inside the large Resource .DLL files, and although of course these
could be located and changed on your own machine, you wouldn't be able
to put them up for download and let others see your breed or pet with its
beautiful new textures.  So, for the breeds which don't include their
furfiles within the breedfile, you will have to include a separate .bmp
with your breed and make the list above point to it (ResHacked breedz
can of course have the bitmaps added internally).  But for hex-painted 
pets of course it is essential to have the bitmap externally unless you 
distribute the breedfile along with the pet.

NOTE:  If you want the pet to work in Petz 5, you _must_ make your furfile
bitmaps either 32x32 pixels, or a combination of multiples of 32 (such as
64x32, 64x128 etc) up to and including 128x128.  If you don't, the pet 
will crash the game.

So you might change line 1 to read:

\resource\catz\jiggy.bmp        0
 
As the information above states, the 0 or 1 indicate whether the texture
is to be used as single or multi-colour.  This can make a big difference
to its visibility and the way the ballz colour shows up with a texture;
change the various balls' base colour for the Tabby cat, for instance,
and the stripes will be a different colour.  Occasionally you will see
numbers other than 0 or 1, such as 65; that number should indicate which
colour in the "background" part of the texture will allow your ball
colour to show through.  

When you come to the Texture column in the [Ballz Info], remember that
the first texture in the above list is referred to as 0, the second 1,
the third 2, etc, for as many textures as you wish to include.

And now the ballz themselves:

;FUZZ --> -1 = no outline, 0 = half outline, > 0 = outline thickness
;OUTLINE --> -1 = no outline, 0 = half outline, > 0 = outline thickness
;col  outCol spklCl fuzz  otlntTyp sizeDif  group    texture 
[Ballz Info]
 15,  244,   244,   2,      -2,       27,       3,     1  eBall_ankleL,

etc

I think these are pretty self-explanatory; the first three columns deal
with colours (main, outline and speckle).  Speckle is really a throwback
to the Catz 1 and Dogz 1 days.  Then there's the degree of fuzz , the
thickness or lack of outline, the relative size of the ball (you can get
some amazing shapes by using huge positive numbers, and make some balls
effectively disappear with huge negative numbers), the group (you'll
probably not want to change that, unless you have certain types of
2nd-gen pet problems) and which texture it uses (if any; put -1 if you
don't want any texture).  It's even got a handy eBall_ note at the end
of each line to show which ball is being referred to...  Mess with these
numbers to your heart's content...

And now the last few sections.  These next two are dealt with in my .LNZ
breakdown chunks; please read about them there if you're interested. 
They basically have an effect if you're breeding petz:

[Fur Color Areas]
[Fur Markings]

Now, here's a useful item if you want to make a breed with an appendage
that you can't or don't want to make out of one of its ballz.  This is
from the Chinchilla Persian, but you can add it to any breed so long as
you compensate by removing the right number of spaces elsewhere.  I did
this with the Antlers for my Elks. In some breeds you can see:

[Add Clothing]
#3.C
; kind          toy_dll         lnz file
Hat "\Resource\Clothes\Pink Bow.clo"
"\art\Sprites\Toyz\Clot_HatBowPink\Clot_HatBowPink.clz"
#2
Hat "\Resource\Clothes\Pink Bow.clo"
"\art\Sprites\Toyz\Clot_HatBowPink\Clot_HatBowPink.clz"
#1
##

Great!  You can hex edit an item of clothing and make the breed come out
of the Adoption Centre wearing it!  Even better, if your breed is one
where the item is used only in the male or only in the female, there is
this:

; sexist - pink bow <=> female
[Force To Female]
#3.C
1
#2
1
#1
0
##

[Force To Male]
#3.C
0
#2
0
#1
1
##

the 1 and the 0 are switches to say whether this particular variation of
the breed should be male or female, and in the first part of the [Add
Clothing] section it shows that the #3.C and #2 versions have a bow.  So
#3.C and #2 ae forced to female, and #1 is forced to male.

In some breeds also there is this:

[Adjust Clothing]
; kind: Shirt, Pant, Sock_FrontL, Sock_FrontR, <etc>
; kind offset scale (floating point, 1.0 is no change in size)
Hat     0,-7,0      0.9

You only need this section -- and to change it -- if some item of
clothing doesn't look right on the breed. Choose from the list of items
shown for the "kind" column.  The offset is the usual x,y,z co-ordinates
relative to where the clothing item sits normally,  so that you can
shift it to a different position. The scale allows you to make it look
bigger or smaller.

Back to the Persian, then there's this, which isn't particularly exciting
to change 

[Lnz Version]
2

And now we're into the kitten (or puppy) section, which you need to
change if you want extensions and enlargements etc to be different in
the youngster of your breed.  

; persian kitten

[Default Linez File]
\ptzfiles\cat\pr\pr.lnz

It tells the game where the adult .lnz is to be found.  You can put 
an appropriate .lnz onto the hard drive and redirect this url to it as 
shown in my external-lnz packages.  You can of course do the same with the 

[Default Linez File]
\ptzfiles\dog\dogmaster.lnz

or 

[Default Linez File]
\ptzfiles\dog\catmaster.lnz

files, but there's not really much point in doing so with those because
of course everything that you put into your breedfile's .lnz overrides
the "master" .lnz defaults.

Don't forget this:

[Default Scales];adult 113, 113
88              ; normal pet scale
94              ; normal ball scale

Which can be the same as or different from the adult's defaults of
course, and we even get a small [Project Ball] section which you can
fiddle with in the same way if you want.

If you've carefully changed sizes and fuzz, you'll want to remove the
[Ball Size Override] and [Fuzz Override] sections...  And voila!  here
we are at the end of the breed's characteristics!

Remember that if you're using a hex editor to put your edited .LNZ back
into the breedfile, make sure that this text file is exactly the same
length as it was when you took it out of the breedfile, then copy and
paste it back into the same place.  If you're keeping it as an Easy-Edit
external file, or are using Resource Hacker, that isn't relevant.

You can now run your breed and see how it looks, and adopt hex-painted
petz from it.

Enjoy!

The Animator's Add Balls are a little different in each breed, because
of the different needs that different breedz have.  For instance, the
Tabby cat has stripes which need to be specified...  You can work them
out by studying the relevant breed's .LNZ, so I include only the more
standard ones here:

67 mount align ball
68 steal captured toy align ball
69 steal toy standing align ball
70 dig align ball
71 fill in hole align ball
72 rest on pillow align ball
73 drop object at point align ball
74 utility ball
75 utility ball
76 utility ball
(there's probably no need to touch 67-76 usually -- they are invisible
placement balls really)

The following are different in some breeds; just check out the one
you're working with:

77 } nose
78 }
79 }

80 } head -- Ears region
81 }
82 }
85 }
86 }
87 } left side top of head in front of ear (near jowl and cheek)
88 }
89 } right side top of head in front of ear (near jowl and cheek)
90 } ears
91 }

92} Fangs (See Alleycat) or Ruff (see maine Coon)
93}

The Animator's Add Balls are a little different in each breed, because
of the different needs that different breedz have.  For instance, the
Poodle has tufts which need to be specified...  You can work them out by
studying the relevant breed's .LNZ, so I include only the more standard
ones here:

67 mount align ball 
68 steal captured toy align ball
69 steal toy standing align ball
70 dig align ball
71 fill in hole align ball
72 rest on pillow align ball
73 drop object at point align ball
74 utility ball 
75 utility ball 
76 utility ball 
(there's probably no need to touch 67-76 usually -- they are invisible
placement balls really)

The following are different in some breeds; just check out the one
you're working with:

77   } ears outside; top spot on left 
78   }       and second from top right 
79   }       and second from top left?
80   } ears outside, top spot on right 
81   }      and third from top on R
82   }      third from top spot on L 

83   } tail
84   }  
85   }
86   }
87   }

88   }  tongue (or chin)

89   } test cover up part of jowls
90   } test cover up part of jowls
91   } cheek/jowls; go from cheek or mouth 
92   }              corners to snout or nose

93   } Inside mouth at front above chin; L
94   } Inside mouth at front above chin; R

As an example of differences and extra balls, take the Poodle:
poodle head puff 89-91
poodle puffs 92-95
poodle puffs without outlines for unshaved poodles 96-99
