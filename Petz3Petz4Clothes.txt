Tools.
======


To do it my way, you need a hex editor.  If you don't have one, there are loads of 
them available for download, and they all do the same basic tasks, although some of 
them have complicated "bells and whistles" too for power-users.  You can get various 
freeware ones, such as: 
AXE VERSION 2.0 or 2.1 downloadable from my site or from Daniel Wright's Odd-Petz site.
Hexedit, from http://www.okinfoweb.com/moe/files/hexedit.zip 
Hexedit (yes, same name, different program) from
http://www-physics.mps.ohio-state.edu/~prewett/hexedit/index.html

All of them are pretty straightforward to install.  If you have the shortcut to your chosen 
one on your desktop, you can drag-and-drop any file you want to investigate onto it.  
They all show files in a similar way: there are three sections, the left-hand one being 
the "Address" section and containing numbers which show which byte you're looking at 
(in Hex numbers usually), and it starts at 00.  The middle section is the meat of the 
thing, being the actual data of the file shown as hexadecimal numbers.  The right-hand 
side shows the file itself also, but in this case as raw ASCII so that you see it as a 
mix of weird symbols or dots and text.  Most of the time you will be looking at that 
right-hand section in order to find or fiddle with bits of text.

You can also use a modern-day Resource Editor such as ResHacker, which a lot of people
now use, but be warned -- a lot of people find that Reshacker is frustrating, causing
crashes etc, after a file has been edited a few times.

Other useful tools
------------------

Notepad.exe -- came with Windows.  Used for altering the CLZ files (which are actually
text files).  

Mspaint.exe -- came with Windows; you might want it (or a paint package of 
your choice) to edit texture files.

Editing Clothes files
=====================

Before you start editing your new clothing, make sure that you have a copy 
of the original somewhere safe.  Also keeping copies of the new file as you 
go along is no bad thing.

Another thing to remember -- and this is important -- is that the file must 
be exactly the same size after you've finished.  You can see what size the 
file is at any time by right-clicking on it in Windows Explorer and choosing 
"properties".

THE BYTE
--------

This something which is very important if you want your clothing to show up 
separately in the clothes closet: the offset byte/ID number.  Don't panic!  This 
is actually very simple when you know what to look for.  

I'm going to use as my example the Antlers.clo file which I modified to make my 
Swedish Elk's antlers.  Other clothing may be slightly different -- i.e. where 
the Antlers file has "[Add Clothing]" the buckskin pants have "[Flat Clothing]", 
and the offset bytes will have different numbers, etc -- but this is easy to 
figure out if you just concentrate a little.

Okay, the offset bytes come above [Add Clothing]; in the line directly above 
for Petz 3, and a few lines above in Petz 4, directly above the on-screen tips.  
(NOTE -- in clothing which makes use of internal bitmaps for textures, these 
bytes will come just before the bitmap which comes before the [Flat Clothing].  
Just search for the first instance of BM and it's the line above _that_ which 
you're going to look for.) If you look in the hex numbers section of the editor, 
you will see a series of numbers which look like this:

0000 853E 0000 0200

Either of the two bytes 85 and 3E can be changed to just about any other 
hexadecimal number.  In case you're not familiar with the way Hex numbers 
count upwards, here's a table of our normal Decimal system alongside the 
Hexadecimal:

Dec	Hex
 0	00
 1	01
 2	02
 3	03
 4	04
 5	05
 6	06
 7	07
 8	08
 9	09
 10	0A
 11	0B
 12	0C
 13	0D
 14	0E
 15	0F
 16	10
 17	11
 18	12
etc

If you're still not sure, use the calculator that comes with Windows; 
choose View > Scientific.  You can then put in a number in Decimal (Dec) 
and see it converted to Hex.

Although you can easily choose a number that won't clash with other clothes 
on your computer, if you want to make them available to others, you're going 
to come up against one small problem that we all have; making sure that they 
don't clash with anyone else's.  There's no guaranteed way of assuring this 
for clothes (no system such as the PetzGallery standard for breedz), so it's 
best to put a warning to this effect with the file or you'll get _lots_ of 
email about it.

THE NAME
--------

Okay, now that you've done the byte, now you want to rename the file.    First 
off, you'll need to physically name it, so save what you've done so far and exit 
from the hex editor.  Name the breed and re-open it into the editor.  Now search 
for the Hex string:

50004600

This gets you down to the bottom of the file, where the bit that looks like 
P.F.M.a.g.i.c starts, and just above the breed name which looks like

000072D0 0000 0000 0000 0000 0700 4100 6E00 7400 ..........A.n.t.
000072E0 6C00 6500 7200 7300 0700 4100 6E00 7400 l.e.r.s...A.n.t.
000072F0 6C00 6500 7200 7300 0F00 4300 6C00 6F00 l.e.r.s...C.l.o.
00007300 7400 5F00 4800 6100 7400 4100 6E00 7400 t._.H.a.t.A.n.t.
00007310 6C00 6500 7200 7300 0000 0000 0000 0000 l.e.r.s.........

Don't touch the C.l.o.t._.H.a.t.A.n.t.l.e.r.s.  Just change each of the 
two A.n.t.l.e.r.s to your chosen name.

Don't go changing the dots in between the letters -- those _have_ to be null 
bytes (hex 00).  Now, if it's longer than the original name you'll have to add 
the final letters, with 00 between each letter.  This makes the clothesfile 
longer than it was so, in the area of null bytes after C.l.o.t._.H.a.t.A.n.t.l.e.r.s 
delete the same number of bytes.  Also, the letter count is wrong.  "Eh?  Wot 
letter count?"  I hear you cry...  Well, take a look at the three dots between 
the two A.n.t.l.e.r.s, in the hex section of the editor.  You should see 00 07 00. 
This tells the program that Antlers is 7 letters long. You need to tell the 
program that yours is 9 letters long (or whatever) -- so, change that 07 to 09 
and the letter count is correct.  You'll need to do the same to the number 07 
which is before the first A.n.t.l.e.r.s also.

If the new name were to be shorter than the original, you could leave the letter
count alone and simply fill in the unused letters with null bytes.

You should now be able to open your file and the original in the same game.  
However, remember that your item will look exactly the same as the original 
while it's on the shelf; so far in Petz 5 we haven't found a way of editing the 
little filmstrip graphics for that, although you can use a Resource Editor to change
the current filmstrip for, say, a copy of a toy on-shelf filmstrip .spr (or you can 
make it externally if you don't want to use a Resource Editor).  In Petz 3 and Petz 4 
of course the filmstrip is editable; see my tutorials on filmstrip editing to see how.

So unless you alter the filmstrip, the Antlers will still look like toy antlers until 
you pick it off the shelf.  With all hats and "add ball" clothes it's the same; with 
other items of clothing, such as shirts, pants and socks, you actually need to put 
them on a pet before they will look as you intended.

If you're not changing filmstrips, in Petz 3 and 4 what you can do to help pick it 
out from among all the other identical antlers is to turn on your onscreen tips 
and make sure that the tips for this set are unique.  In Petz 3 The tips are 
just above where you rename the file, in Petz 4 they are just above the [Add Clothing]; 
simply put your own text where it says "Dress up your petz in these reindeer antlers!" or 
"Antlers complete the reindeer outfit".  Whichever item of clothing you are hexing, 
the tips tend to be in either of those two places.

In Petz 5, unless you do as I say above with filmstrips, there is no way of identifying
your own item until it's off the shelf or on the pet.  The on-screen tips are all
inside the big Petz 5 .dll file, and the most that you can do in clothes, toyz or
breedz is to make the game not find the on-screen tip by overwriting the 3-digit reference 
number with spaces.  In the Antelrs, that number is 569:

000052E0 0000 0000 D73A 0000 0300 0000 0000 0000 .....:..........
000052F0 3536 3909 5809 3009 3009 3009 3009 2D31 569.X.0.0.0.0.-1
00005300 092D 3109 2D31 092D 3109 2D31 092D 3109 .-1.-1.-1.-1.-1.
00005310 3009 3109 3730 0930 0D0A 0000 0000 0000 0.1.70.0........
00005320 5B41 6464 2043 6C6F 7468 696E 675D 203B [Add Clothing] ;

So you'd change it to look like this:

000052E0 0000 0000 D73A 0000 0300 0000 0000 0000 .....:..........
000052F0 2020 2009 5809 3009 3009 3009 3009 2D31    .X.0.0.0.0.-1
00005300 092D 3109 2D31 092D 3109 2D31 092D 3109 .-1.-1.-1.-1.-1.
00005310 3009 3109 3730 0930 0D0A 0000 0000 0000 0.1.70.0........
00005320 5B41 6464 2043 6C6F 7468 696E 675D 203B [Add Clothing] ;


BITMAPS
-------

Although the Antlers don't have a bitmap texture file, some clothing does.  When you 
spool down the file it comes directly after the offset byte. The part which starts 
with BM is what I'm talking about here; highlight from the beginning of BM to the 
beginning of [Flat Clothing]; copy that to a new file, save it as a .bmp file and 
edit it to suit yourself in a  paint package.  Make sure that the edited bitmap is 
exactly the same size before you copy it back over the section in the clothes file.

You can of course ignore this bitmap entirely and make a .bmp of your own size and 
style; you would need to put this in a suitable subdirectory and make sure that the 
texture list in the .CLZ file (mentioned below) points to it.

The bitmap should be 256-colour.

Remember that Petz 5 will crash if any bitmap is not some multiple of 32 pixels by
some multiple of 32 pixels in size (32x32, 32x64 etc)  

THE MAIN PART OF THE CLOTHING; THE SIZE, SHAPE, ETC
---------------------------------------------------

Now we come to the core of the clothing; the .CLZ file which makes up the shape, 
size and what part of the body it's going to fit onto.

In a "hat" type item it starts with

[Add Clothing]

and continues down to 

end ; linez

(Some clothing might not have the ; linez at the end, but if so you should be able 
to figure out where the letters and numbers have finished and the binary stuff starts 
if you look closely.  Many of the "flat clothing" items finish with "end ; paintballs")

Now, this whole section is actually an area of ordinary ASCII text (letters and numbers).  
You'll probably want to do lots of editing here...  There are three ways of doing this.  
Either laboriously go through it, byte by byte, in the hex editor; many people do that.  
Or, if you're familiar with Vim, you can edit it pretty quickly; the drawback is that you 
have to be familiar with Vim's quirks.  Don't ask me how to use it or even where to find
it -- Vim hates me and the feeling is mutual ;-)

Or, if you like using Notepad, just copy out the whole area from "[Add Clothing]" to 
"; linez" into a new file, save it as a .txt file, edit it in Notepad, and re-save it 
in the right place in the file.  I use the last -- i.e. the Notepad method -- because 
I'm comfortable with it.  _Don't_ use Wordpad or any more sophisticated program such 
as Word, as that can put in hidden characters that you don't want.

With hat objects such as the antlers, the general rule is that the ball information 
is actual extra balls which construct the item and which are then attached to the pet.  
So we have "add balls" and "linez", the initial columns of which relate to the actual 
balls in the clothing itself.  With shirts, pants etc (or [Flat clothing] objects), 
we usually see "ballinfo" and "paintballs", the initial columns of which relate to 
whichever ball each section of shirt/pants attaches itself to in the pet.  Basically, 
in this latter type of clothing, the balls cover each specified pet ball.

The following annotated .CLZ is given assuming that you are using Notepad; it will look 
different to you in a Hex editor, because you won't see them as columns, just a constant 
wrap-around stream of letters and numbers.  

[Add Clothing] ; reindeer antlers
; kind: Shirt,Pant,Sock_FrontL,Sock_FrontR,Sock_BackL,Sock_BackR,Tail,Hat,Hat2,EarringL,EarringR,NoseThing,NoseThing2,Glasses
Hat

This tells the game it's a hat object.

; textures                           isremapable    width height (optional)
\art\textures\hair10.bmp             1
end ; textures

This tells the game what texture you're going to use.  You can redirect it to a bitmap 
in a directory of your choice, of course.

; petscale  ballscale  baseBallSize  numPetBalls numPetLines
  90        103        65            

I think that's pretty easy to understand; change the numbers to the scales you want.

This next part tells the game if a cat or dog can wear it, and where exactly:

;bBall offset       color  outCol  fuzz  colGroup  outType  size  texture
#2.A ; Dog
-52    0,-80,-13    59     55      1     0         -1       0    0
#1 ; Cat
-24    0,-80,-13    59     55      1     0         -1        0    0
##

This next bit is the "addballz" which describe the bottom of the antlers from the 
headband to first spike. Remember, in this case the first column relates to the ball 
_within the antler ball set_ to which the added ball is attached.  If this were not 
the case, you'd see the antlers attaching themselves to one of the ankles :-)

The first two lines are from headband up.  Remember that the columns are the same as those above:
Ball  offset       color  outCol  fuzz  colGroup  outType  size  texture
(first added ball onwards)
0      20,15,0         65     55     2     0       -1      25	   0
0      -20,15,0        65     55     2     0       -1      25    0

(5th added ball onwards) this bit is the headband.

(11th ball) antlers -- this bit is the antler spikes. 
The first four lines are the forward-jutting one, the third and fourth lines being the tip.
The fifth and seventh and ninth lines are the area to the back of the upright (left Antler)
The sixth and eighth and tenth ditto for the right (starting from the upright)
The eleventh - fourteenth lines are the two spikes near the back end.

And now we come to the "Linez" information; in other words, which ball is attached to which, 
with how much fuzz on the lines and the colour/thickness of line information.

(etc etc)

In an item of [Flat Clothing], as I say above, the sections are a little different.  
Taking my Dance Dress as an example, we have the beginning very similar to the Antlers:

[Flat Clothing] ; Plaid Pants
; kind: Shirt,Pant,Sock_FrontL,Sock_FrontR,Sock_BackL,Sock_BackR,Tail,Hat,EarringL,EarringR,NoseThing,Glasses
Pant

Which tells us it's a "pant" object.  Then there's the texture list, and then the ballinfo 
list -- and in this case, the first column is the ball _within the breed ball set_ which 
the particular clothing ball is going to cover:

; ball  color  outCol  fuzz  outType  sizeDiff  pgroup  texture
#2.A ; Dog

This means that until we get to 

#1 ; Cat

All the info is relevant to the dog.  So

;butt hips knees ankles
49	65	-1	0	-1	35	0	0
19	65	-1	0	-1	85	0	0

means we've finished with the ball info.  There is then a paintballs section at the end:

and of course you can add patches here in the same way as you would put patches on a 
Calico Cat or Dalmatian.  But remember to remove the ";" from the beginning of any 
line of numbers that you wish to use, or your changes won't work.

When you alter any of the items, make sure that you either add or remove spaces to 
compensate, so that the file will remain the same size.  then paste it back into your 
clothing file in the correct place, save it in the clothes directory, open the game 
and eureka!  Your new item of clothing will be on the shelf :-))

A note on petz 4 Hosts' clothes, and Petz 5
==========================================

Some clothing doesn't show up in the Clothes Closet; this is the clothing specially 
designed for the playscene Hosts, and it doesn't show up for two reasons -- first, 
there is a special byte that is set to 01; e.g. the Admiral's hat has: 0000 153B 0000 0100.  
Change that 01 to 03 or 02.  Secondly, there is a missing filmstrip which means that
it will only appear as a blank section of shelf anyway.  Unfortunately, if you try to 
take that clothing off the shelf where you think it must be, it is likely to throw up an 
error message about a missing .flh, and close the game, unless you have added a pair of 
suitable flh/flm files externally (or internally using a Resource Editor).  

If you are hexing the clothing of one of your playscene Hosts, for that host to wear, the 
editing of the .Clz section is exactly as described above.

If you want the clothing that a Host wears, to place on the shelf and put on other pets, 
then it would be wisest to copy the .CLZ section out of it (and any required bitmap) and 
pop it into a copy of some normal item of clothing.  Then give it its own offset number, 
on-screen tips, and rename it -- only don't rename it to exactly the Host's clothing name, 
because otherwise the game will probably crash when the Host tries to wear it.

This palaver isn't necessary in Petz 5 because there are a set of non-Host-enabled 
Host-type clothes already in the closet. 

Enjoy

P.S. at the bottom of the file, between the on-screen tips and the name, is this:
Sounds root path=Art\NewDownloads\Toyz\Clot_HatAntlers\Sounds
NONE
I've not tried fiddling with this, but it might be fun to see if your clothing will 
make a noise if you change that to a .wav file in a subdirectory of your choice...
Most likely it won't unless the original clothing item happens to have a sound, but
there's no harm trying.
