As to the size of pigletz and other Speciez, there will be a
significant number which will turn out small, also (with pigz and bunniez) 
a large number that will have pink eyes.  It would seem that this is because 
the game engine has some kind of defaults that will often override the 
information in a breedfile; it's probably the mechanism which causes 
mutations normally.  

Some hexed breedz are deliberately made with the Default Scales too large
or too small for the game to accept, although it does accept them in first-
generation adopted pets.  But then the 2nd-gens default to the game's own 
idea of defaults.  In the case of the pig and bunny, however, this is 
not the case. 

Such tiny piglets, elks, etc have no problems.  By the way, there is a site
called "Lilliput"
http://www.gregg5.fsnet.co.uk/LPRL/Index.htm
where they specialise in miniature pets; there's a huge demand for them,
apparently.  These are all supposed to have been bred without any hexing, so
you can see that the game will produce miniatures normally anyway.  It's just
that the probability is higher for a mini-pet with the hexed speciez breedz.

There is no danger to your game or to other pets in keeping miniatures.
However, if you want to make your babies bigger and can't seem to breed 
them the size you want, you can (with great care) change the numbers for the 
default sizes within the petfile.  Search for Default Scales (there will be 
two places where you will find this) and alter the numbers to suit yourself,
but remember to alter some unimportant numbers in the Paint Ballz areas such
that the checksum remains the same as before.  If you don't know what I'm
talking about, download my "editing petfiles" tutorial and read it carefully
before touching the numbers inside your pet.

Hope that helps
